                <h3>10 Reasons Why you Really Need a Property Manager in Abu Dhabi</h3>
                <p>
                Owning property is like having a gold mine. It can bring in money without you lifting a finger, especially if you think long-term. But managing that property? 
                That's a full-time job, especially in Abu Dhabi. This is where a  <a style='text-decoration: none' href='https://transparentpm.ae/property-management'> property manager</a> can be your hero.
                </p>
                <p>Here's why:</p>
                <h3>1. Get Your Place Rented Faster:</h3>
                <p>
                Thinking anyone can rent out a property? Many owners simply hope for the best, but time is money. Every vacant week costs you 1.9% of potential return—that's almost 8% in a month! 
                A savvy property manager uses their market knowledge and broad connections to find tenants fast. Choose one who values your property and collaborates with external leasing agents.
                </p>
                <h3>2. Pick the Right Tenants:</h3>
                <p>
                You want tenants who respect your property and pay on time. 
                A seasoned property manager checks potential renters properly and will have procedure in place to minimize risks. This means you're more likely to have tenants who won't give you headaches.
                </p>
                <h3>3. Get Your Rent On Time:</h3>
                <p>
                Chasing rent isn't fun. A property manager takes care of this, ensuring you get your money regularly. If there are delays, they handle it, so you don't have to.
                </p>
                <h3>4. Find Reliable Maintenance Solutions for You:</h3>
                <p>
                In Abu Dhabi, fixing things isn't always a walk in the park. You'll encounter structural issues, the challenge of sourcing parts, and the task of finding trustworthy technicians. Property managers come equipped with a trusted network of technicians and an in-house <a style='text-decoration: none' href='https://transparentpm.ae/property-maintenance'>maintenance team </a> ready to tackle these issues. 
                Having faced many "mysterious maintenance problems" in the past, they handle repairs efficiently. And the best part? You don't have to shoulder the stress of frustrated renters.
                </p>
                <h3>5. Stay On the Right Side of the Law:</h3>
                <p>
                Laws and regulations, especially those related to renting in Abu Dhabi, are frequently changing. It's all too easy to overlook a detail or find yourself stuck, not knowing the next step. (The process of obtaining Tawtheeq, especially for overseas landlords, is a prime example.) 
                Property managers stay current with these updates. Armed with their expertise, they navigate these complexities, ensuring both you and your property remain compliant.
                </p>
                <h3>6. Emergencies? We've Got You Covered:</h3>
                <p>
                It feels like emergencies always strike at the worst times, doesn't it? Whether it's late at night or on a public holiday, unexpected issues like plumbing malfunctions, AC breakdowns, or power outages can arise. 
                But with a property manager on your side, you're shielded from those frantic midnight calls and pressing repairs.
                </p>
                <h3>7. Stay Informed About Your Finances:</h3>
                <p>
                Your property manager provides you with consistent updates on the income and expenses for your property. 
                This clear insight ensures you're always up-to-date on your financial position and saves you time on filing your tax returns.
                </p>
                <h3>8. All Your Paperwork Sorted:</h3>
                <p>
                Managing a property means keeping track of countless details. It's frustrating when you need specific information, like a tenancy agreement, move-in inspection report, or Tawtheeq, and just can't find it. We've seen many owners in this predicament. 
                But with a diligent property manager, all essential documents are organized and ready. When you need something, they've got your back - ensuring you're never left in the lurch.
                </p>
                <h3>9. Stress Reduction:</h3>
                <p>
                Perhaps the most significant benefit is the peace of mind you receive. Knowing that a professional is handling the day-to-day challenges allows you to enjoy the rewards of your investment without the associated stress. 
                Plus, not having to deal with tenants can greatly relieve your stress.
                </p>
                <h3>10. Navigating Difficult Tenants and Situations with Expertise:</h3>
                <p>
                Navigating challenging tenant scenarios or complex rental situations is part of the course for seasoned property managers. 
                With their vast experience, they guide you through potential legal complications and offer efficient resolutions, ensuring minimal disruption. Leveraging their expertise can be instrumental in safeguarding your time, resources, and investment.
                </p>

                </p>
                <p>
                In conclusion, you can try doing it all on your own, but it won't be easy. Most property owners either lack the know-how or the time. A property manager bridges that gap, ensuring smooth sailing for your property without you having to worry about it. 
                Our advice? Choose a good property manager who is professional, integral, and proactive, and truly understands your property's needs. Trust us, it will be a game-changer for you.

                <h3>Proactive Property Management: 7 Tips for Effective Maintenance in Abu Dhabi </h3>
                <p>
                Few things frustrate tenants more than unresolved maintenance issues. They not only lead to tenancy disputes but also prompt tenants to seek alternative accommodations. 
                These issues cause discomfort for tenants and can be a real headache for you, the landlord. Even with the best intentions, swift resolution of  <a style='text-decoration: none' href='https://transparentpm.ae/property-maintenance'>maintenance problems</a> isn't always guaranteed, and as time goes by, tensions tend to rise.
                </p>
                <p>In this article, we aim to share our insights on effectively handling maintenance issues, especially in the context of Abu Dhabi.</p>
                <h3>1. Expect Maintenance Issues to Occur:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Accepting the Inevitable</b>: Despite our desire for flawless properties, all face maintenance issues. Structural problems arise within the first year, and major AC, water heater, or appliance issues appear around year seven. 
                        Even during the 'honeymoon' period, minor leaks or carpentry issues can arise.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Financial and Mental Readiness</b>: Anticipating maintenance issues at any time allows for financial and mental preparation. 
                        Allocate a maintenance budget, especially as your property ages, and prepare to address urgent issues promptly, fostering positive tenant relationships.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Non-Negotiable Maintenance Responsibilities</b>: If your tenant is experiencing issues related to essential services like AC, clean water, or electricity, you are legally obligated to address these problems, these are non-negotiable. 
                        However, when it comes to cosmetic improvements, the decision is at your discretion.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>2. Choose Ready-Built Properties:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Inspect Before Buying</b>: While discussing buying ready-built properties in a maintenance-focused article may seem unusual, it's crucial. When purchasing off-plan, you can only consider factors like price and location. 
                        However, inspecting a completed property allows you to assess build quality and replacement part accessibility, preventing future issues.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Avoiding Structural Issues</b>: Structural problems, like foundation issues or burst pipes within walls, are the most challenging. As an individual landlord, resolving these is daunting, expensive, causing frustration while tenants grow impatient. 
                        Purchasing properties with existing occupants allows for physical assessments to prevent future maintenance headaches.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>3. Regular Inspection and Preventative Maintenance:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b> Scheduled Inspections</b>: Regular inspections, coupled with a preventative maintenance plan, enable the identification of potential issues before they escalate into major problems. This includes checking AC systems, electrical components, unblocking drainage, and pest control. 
                        Addressing minor issues promptly can prevent them from evolving into major concerns.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b> Preventing Tenant Negligence Issues</b>: Not all tenants report maintenance issues promptly. Some may overlook problems until they move out, by which time it's often too late. 
                        Regular inspections increase the likelihood of identifying and addressing these issues before they escalate.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>4. Transparent Communication with Tenants:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Streamlined Maintenance Reporting</b>: Establishing a clear process for tenants to report maintenance issues and ensuring they know how to contact you is essential. 
                        Though it adds up to your work load, encourage tenants to report even minor issues to prevent hidden problems.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Timely Responses</b>: Respond promptly to maintenance requests, even if it's just to acknowledge receipt. Setting clear repair timelines instills confidence in the tenant that the issue will be resolved promptly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Keeping Tenants Informed</b>: Regularly update tenants on the progress of repairs to foster trust and satisfaction. Transparency helps tenants understand when they can expect resolution.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>5. Qualified Contractors:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Choose Experienced Contractors Wisely</b>: Finding skilled and dependable contractors is already a challenge, and in Abu Dhabi, you also need to consider their familiarity with your specific complexes. This insider knowledge can be invaluable, as it often contains know-how not found in maintenance textbooks but will nonetheless make or break your maintenance projects. 
                        Price is not the only consideration in Abu Dhabi.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>6. Find a Good Tenant:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Your Tenant Makes or Breaks Your Property</b>: A good tenant minimizes maintenance work and boosts property popularity for re-renting, while a bad tenant can lead to significant issues. 
                        For instance, one of our clients faced tenant troubles when their tenant ran off and even stole a water pump from his villa.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>7. Handling Time-Consuming Maintenance Issues:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Unraveling Maintenance Mysteries</b>: While 80% of maintenance issues have straightforward solutions, the remaining 20% can be puzzling. 
                        Solving them demands a meticulous examination of every factor and often requires extensive investigation and collaboration with multiple parties to pinpoint the source of the problem.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Appliance Maintenance Challenges</b>: Repairs, regardless of the brand, are often time-consuming due to infrequent service visits from Dubai-based companies, resulting in delays and costs. 
                        Consider dedicating the necessary effort and time for repairs (and prepare your tenant for this), or opt for a simpler solution by replacing appliances every few years.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                We are in the field of Abu Dhabi Property Management long enough to encounter many landlords seeking assistance with tenant disputes. 
                Mediating conflicts between landlords and tenants is a daily part of our routine, and we understand the unique challenges that come with it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Very often we'd hear one party threaten to take legal action, if their demands are not met, and the other party would quickly respond with, "Bring it on, let's go to court."
            </p>
            <p>
                It seems like going to court is the only solution for tenancy disputes.
            </p>
            <p>
                But as any experienced property manager would know, court proceedings are pricy, time consuming and may or may not yield much financial benefits. It should be treated as the last resort not the first.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this article, we'll discuss the proper ways to amicably settle disagreements with your tenants without resorting to court (or the rental dispute council) to mitigate your financial losses.
            </p>
            <h3>1. Prevention is Always Better Than a Solution</h3>
            <p>
                It may sound cliché, but it still holds true in  <a style='text-decoration: none' href='https://transparentpm.ae/property-management'>property management</a>. By taking the following steps, you can reduce the chances of encountering disputes with your tenants significantly.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Screen Your Tenants</b>: Your property is one of your most valuable assets. A good tenant can enhance it, while a troublesome one can cause significant financial and time losses. 
                    Screen your tenants carefully to avoid such issues.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Detailed Tenancy Contracts</b>: A comprehensive tenancy agreement is essential. It serves as a guiding principle for conflict resolution and clarifies tenant responsibilities and landlord rights. 
                    Don't leave room for dispute by opting for simple green tenancy contract.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Payment Mechanisms</b>: While many landlords accept monthly payments, it can be a risky move. Late or unpaid rent is a common cause of disputes. 
                    Limiting payments to quarterly or annually can reduce your risk and stress.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Build Trusting Relationships</b>: Establishing a good, trusting relationship with your tenants from the start can go a long way. 
                    It's natural to be kind to those who reciprocate, and positive relationships can prevent conflicts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Tawtheeq Matters</b>: Make sure you issue your tenants the Tawtheeq and understand the terms in it. In Abu Dhabi, without a valid Tawtheeq, you cannot proceed with any legal assistance. 
                    And judges often judge based on terms in accordance with Tawtheeq.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Don't Fear Non-Renewal</b>: If tenants show signs of incorporation, consider not renewing their leases. The longer they stay, the more likely they cause more headaches.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2. Quick Solutions to Maintenance Problems</h3>
            <p>
                <a style='text-decoration: none' href='https://transparentpm.ae/property-maintenance'>Maintenance issues</a> are often underestimated by landlords. Disagreements about maintenance and liability are another major source of tenancy dispute. Find tenants that will look after your place. 
                Embrace tenant-reported maintenance requests as opportunities to maintain property quality and act on tenants' requests quickly if it's under your responsibility.
            </p>
            <h3>3. Resolving Tenancy Disputes Amicably</h3>
            <p>
                Before considering legal action, it's essential to attempt amicable resolution:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Stay Impartial</b>: In any dispute, impartiality is crucial. Try to understand the tenant's perspective and concerns, even if you believe you are 100% at the right. 
                    Delve deep to uncover the root cause before jumping to conclusions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Be Rational</b>: Avoid impulsive decisions. Whether you opt for negotiation or the legal route, make a well-considered choice. 
                    Understand your risks, costs, benefits, motives, objectives and chances of winning, if you do decide to take legal action. Parties often underestimate the time and financial requirements, including lawyer's fees, and overestimate their financial gain before pursuing legal action.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Compromise</b>: Negotiation involves give and take. Identify what matters most to both you and your tenant, and propose a compromised solution to settle the case between parties.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Appeal to Tenants' Conscience</b>: Encourage tenants to act in good faith by highlighting the importance of a harmonious landlord-tenant relationship.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Seek a Mediator</b>: If you feel you've reached an impasse, consider involving a mediator. 
                    Bringing in a neutral third party, such as a friend or a property manager, can offer fresh perspectives and potentially unlock solutions to the situation.
                </li>
            </ul>

            </p>
            <h3>4. Filing a Case at the Rental Dispute Council</h3>
            <p>
                When all else fails, and legal action becomes necessary, you can file a case at the Rental Dispute Council:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Prepare Your Petition</b>: Your might need a lawyer to help you prepare it for submitting to the council.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Visiting the Rental Dispute Council:</b>: Visit the council in person or through your Power of Attorney (preferably someone fluent in Arabic). 
                    Complete the complaint form, pay the required fees (usually 4% of annual rent, capped at AED 10,000, plus additional fees if needed), and receive a date for the first case session.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                In my time at TPM, I've seen many property owners, mostly from overseas, grapple with the intricacies of departing the UAE. 
                If you're on the brink of bidding Abu Dhabi adieu, either temporarily or permanently, here's a distilled guide to manage your property seamlessly.
            </p>
            <p>
                A. Prior to Resigning, Equip Yourself with These Insights:
            </p>
            <h3>1. The Golden Visa Quest</h3>
            <p>
                Certain Golden Visa categories need an employment certificate for validation. If you're eligible, begin the application before your resignation. 
                This not only retains your UAE residency but also streamlines future property-related dealings.
            </p>
        
            <h3>2. The Re-mortgage Consideration</h3>
            <p>
                Considering a mortgage? Address it pre-resignation. Banks insist on employment certificates. 
                Once you're overseas, your negotiation leverage with banks diminishes.
            </p>
            <h3>3. Diversify Bank Accounts</h3>
            <p>
                If your primary account is linked to a mortgage, open an additional one. 
                Banks might sometimes freeze accounts of those leaving the UAE. Being prepared is prudent.
            </p>
            <h3>4. Stay EMID Updated</h3>
            <p>
                With a Golden Visa or EMID, keep your details updated across banks and service providers. 
                It's about ensuring a continuous service experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                B. Essentials to Tackle Before Departure:
            </p>
            <h3>5. Activate Your UAE Pass </h3>
            <p>
                Handle this while in the UAE. Retain your activation phone; It's essential for seamless UAE Pass operations from abroad. 
                If you encounter any issues, refrain from adjusting any settings without expert guidance.
            </p>
            <h3>6. Property Decisions: Sell or Rent?</h3>
            <p>
                Selling can be a slow burn. If your property is jointly owned, it's wise to have a shared local bank account. 
                Considering a contingency plan, like enlisting <a style='text-decoration: none' href='https://transparentpm.ae/articles/10-reasons-why-you-really-need-a-property-manager-in-abu-dhabi'>a property manager</a> or securing <a style='text-decoration: none' href='https://transparentpm.ae/owner-support/power-of-attorney'>a POA</a>, is invaluable.
            </p>
            <div style='display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center'>
                <img src='https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4D12AQHPoV1Gj8yo6Q/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1697106807408?e=1702512000&v=beta&t=dTrLmdp86b-evVhueEwRpY_I2jxN7MzC4HiVIy-cpb8' class='article-img' alt='property-manager-tips' />

            </div>
            <h3>7. Tawtheeq Management </h3>
            <p>
                Maintain it under your name or a trusted manager's.
                Challenges arise when developers discontinue their Tawtheeq services, and tackling this from overseas can be intricate.
            </p>
            <h3>8. Settle Debts </h3>
            <p>
                Clear all outstanding bills. Leave behind only memories, not dues.
            </p>
            <h3>9. Vehicle Matters </h3>
            <p>
                Decide between selling or exporting your vehicle before your residency concludes.
            </p>
            <h3>10. Stamped IBAN Letter </h3>
            <p>
                Seems small, but for those renting to government personnel, it's indispensable.
            </p>
            <p class='quote'>
                "Maintain the Tawtheeq under your name or a trusted manager's. Challenges arise when developers discontinue their Tawtheeq services, and tackling this from overseas can be intricate."
            </p>
            <h3>11. Handling Rental Cheques and Tenancy Issues  </h3>
            <p>
                Keep communication channels open with tenants. Make sure you have means to continue receiving rent or to deposit rental cheques, addressing <a style='text-decoration: none' href='https://transparentpm.ae/property-maintenance'>maintenance</a> issues and renewals.
            </p>
            <h3>12. Re-evaluate Property Insurance </h3>
            <p>
                Review your policy. Ensure it remains intact once you're no longer UAE-based. 
                You might be surprised many insurance providers don't extend their coverage to non-residential property owners.
            </p>
            <h3>13. Departure Dynamics </h3>
            <p>
                If you're on a tight schedule, getting professional help, either via a POA or a property manager, is a strategic move.
            </p>
            <h3>14. Trusted Property Managers </h3>
            <p>
                When leaving, an experienced, trustworthy property manager is worth their weight in gold. Choose wisely.
            </p>
            <h3>15. The POA Advantage</h3>
            <p>
                Even if you're not rushing, <a style='text-decoration: none' href='https://transparentpm.ae/owner-support/power-of-attorney'>a local POA</a> is a great asset. Understand the nuances based on your nationality and visa requirements.

            <p>
                While many emphasize the importance of "<b>location, location, location</b>" in real estate, the truth is that there's a world of considerations beyond this mantra.
            </p>
            <p>
                The UAE's property market is not just thriving; it's a global beacon of safety and luxury, attracting investors from all corners of the world. 
                As <a style='text-decoration: none' href='https://transparentpm.ae/articles/10-reasons-why-you-really-need-a-property-manager-in-abu-dhabi'>a property manager</a> in this thriving market, we've witnessed properties evolve throughout their lifecycles, granting us unique insights that often elude sales and leasing agents.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, we're here to provide you with a property manager's perspective on the pivotal factors to consider when making a real estate investment - factors that go far beyond the obvious elements of location, price, and rental returns.
            </p>
            <h3>1. The Foundation of Your Investment - Build Quality Matters</h3>
            <p>
                When you're stepping into the realm of real estate, the foundation is everything. It's not just about four walls and a roof; it's about the quality of those walls and the integrity of that roof. Common issues like waterproofing is not pleasant but can still be dealt with effectively. However, some problems are more insidious, like foundation issues. 
                That's often beyond the capability of individual property owners. If you're eyeing a villa, take the time to explore the community. Watch for signs of landslides or cracks in exterior walls.
            </p>
    
            <h3>2. Community Management's Impact on Your Investment</h3>
            <p>
                Real estate isn't just a transaction; it's a long-term commitment. 
                Many buyers don't consider, but the quality of community <a style='text-decoration: none' href='https://transparentpm.ae/property-management'>management</a> is a pivotal factor that can significantly impact your property's value.  A reputable community manager can enhance your investment, while a lackluster one can erode it.
                <p>When evaluating community management, consider the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Assess the reputation of the community manager and their track record with other projects.</li>
                    <li>Scrutinize the service charge collection rate. A community can't be effectively managed if a substantial number of owners default on their service charge payments. Stay away from those with high default rates.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>3. Balancing Uniqueness and Maintenance Costs - The Price of Unique Design</h3>
            <p>
                In the pursuit of your real estate dreams, you might be drawn to properties with unique features. They stand out, grab your attention, and promise to set your investment apart. However, unique designs often come with a price tag. 
                They usually require more frequent <a style='text-decoration: none' href='https://transparentpm.ae/articles/7-tips-for-effective-maintenance-in-abu-dhabi'>maintenance</a>, harder to find qualified technicians and can be significantly more costly to replace any defective parts. 
                As you consider such properties, ensure you factor in potential <a style='text-decoration: none' href='https://transparentpm.ae/property-maintenance'>maintenance costs</a> - uniqueness should enhance your investment, not drain it.

            <h3>4. Beyond Handover - Your Ongoing Relationship with Developers - Developer Commitment Post-Purchase</h3>
            <p>
                Your relationship with a property developer doesn't end with the handover. A real estate investment is a long-term endeavor, and you'll likely have ongoing interactions with the developer for matters such as the defect liability period (DLP), sales transfers, or addressing major issues. It's about responsiveness, reliability, and resolving issues that crop up, and developers' commitment post-purchase can make all the difference. 
                Conduct thorough research into the developer's reputation for post-purchase customer service to avoid unpleasant surprises. Buying from a developer who cares after you make your purchase would really save you a lot of headaches down the road.
            </p>
            <h3>5. Navigating the Excitement of Off-Plan Projects - The Off-Plan Risk Equation</h3>
            <p>
                While investor enthusiasm for off-plan projects is often sky-high, it's crucial not to overlook the associated risks. Since you can't physically inspect the property, your investment relies on research and analysis. 
                In addition to seeking information about build quality, community management, and unique designs, you must answer three critical questions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>How confident are you that the project will be completed on time? What's the likelihood of project delays or worst-case scenario, being completely stalled?</li>
                <li>What is the developer's cash flow stability, and how likely are they to encounter financial difficulties before project completion?</li>
                <li>Is there a contingency plan in case the project cannot be delivered as promised, to safeguard your investment?</li>
            </ul>
            <p class='quote'>

            </p>
            <p>
                Scrutinize the developer's financial reports as if you were evaluating a company's stock for investment.
            </p>
            <p>
                And don't be afraid to approach owners who bought from the same developer previously, or someone who knows real estate well but is impartial to your purchasing decision—like us, property managers, who don't have a stake in your real estate purchasing decision.
            </p>
            <p>
                Remember, your real estate investment is substantial, and in-depth research is time well spent.

        <h1 class='article-title'>How to Get a POA Done With NO Title Deed?</h1>
        <div><i style='color: gray'>November 17, 2023</i></div>
        <div class='article-body'>
            <p>
                The UAE offers convenient virtual <a style='text-decoration: none' href='https://transparentpm.ae/owner-support/power-of-attorney'>Power of Attorney</a> (POA) attestation services. However, in some situations, the online route may not be feasible, and the embassy route becomes necessary.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is especially relevant if you require a POA before your properties receive their title deeds. Such a need is common if you require assistance with property handover, applying for title deeds, or managing properties where title deeds are not available. 
                In these cases, it's impossible to have the POA done either through virtual attestation or a physical visit to a notary public.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, what's the solution?
            </p>
            <p>
                The answer is to have it attested overseas.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this article, I will outline the procedure for overseas attestation.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Step 1</b>: Appoint a POA in the UAE
            </p>
            <p>
                Finding a trustworthy individual with the knowledge to assist with the POA procedure in the UAE is crucial. This person should be capable of completing the tasks you assign.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Step 2</b>: Draft the POA
            </p>
            <p>
                A highly critical step. Many reasons can make a POA fail to work. Make sure the one you got is bullet-proof and is guaranteed to work
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>[In your Residing Country]</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Step 3</b>: In your residing country, all principals should sign the POA in the presence of a notary public.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Step 4</b>: Get the POA document attested by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in your residing country. This process is also known as legalization or apostille. 
                (For UK residents, some clients have used this <a href='https://www.apostille.org.uk/'>company</a> for assistance with the legalization process.)
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Step 5</b>: Have the POA certified by the UAE embassy or consulate in your residing country.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Step 6</b>: Courier the legalized and certified POA document to the UAE, and have your appointed POA assist with the subsequent steps.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>[In UAE]</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Step 7</b>: Get the POA stamped by the UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Step 8</b>: Have the POA translated into Arabic by a licensed translator.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Step 9</b>: Have the POA certified by the UAE Ministry of Justice online through the UAE Pass.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>

                    Our advise is <b>totally free</b>. But we will guide you through the best application process and will save you from unnecessary complications.
                </i>
            </p>
            <p>
                Regardless of the method used for attesting the POA, drafting it accurately is a critical step. The effectiveness of your POA largely depends on the quality of the draft. Law firms, translation companies, and notary publics can draft the POA for you. However, it's highly recommended to go for companies with actual experiences using POAs for the specific transaction you intend to undertake. 
                There are too many reasons why a POA can be rejected by the authority.

                Since the introduction of the golden visa scheme in 2019, hundreds of thousands of applications have been submitted. 
                Among all categories, the golden visa application through property investment has been most enticing to foreign investors. 
                It offers an excellent opportunity to own an asset in the UAE while securing a 10-year residency.

                As many know, there are significant differences between these two emirates, as is likely the case with all emirates.
            </p>
            <p>
                Below, I answer several common questions our clients ask about the application process.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>FAQ:</b>
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Do I qualify for a Property Golden Visa Application?</b> You qualify if you own one or more properties in Abu Dhabi with a combined value of at least 2 million dirhams.</li>
                <li><b>Is the property value the same as my purchase price?</b> No, it's based on the current market value, not the original purchase price.</li>
                <li><b>How do I know if my properties meet the 2 million dirhams requirement?</b> The true value is confirmed once you receive an evaluation certificate from Abu Dhabi Municipality. The cost for each certificate is AED 1,053, and each property requires its own certificate.</li>
                <li>
                    <b>How can I estimate the market value of my property?</b> There are several methods, such as checking PropertyFinder for average sales prices. 
                    However, remember these figures are based on advertised, not actual, transaction prices. Real estate agents with recent local transactions can provide insights.
                    Or our favorite is DARI's portal (<a href='https://www.dari.ae/'>www.dari.ae</a>) to check the real transactions value. <b>Log into Dari using your UAE Pass</b> and search for market data. 
                    You can then filter by location, community, and property type. This should provide a graph similar to the one below, displaying the total number of transactions per quarter and the total sales value. To estimate the sales price per transaction, simply perform this calculation: (total sales value) /(total transaction count) = Averaged transaction price.
                </li>

                </div>
                <li><b>If my property is jointly owned, can both owners apply for the Golden Visa?</b> Yes, but the property's minimum value must be AED 2 million per owner. So, a property owned by two people must be worth at least AED 4 million.</li>
                <li><b>What if my jointly owned property doesn't meet the AED 2 million requirement per owner?</b> Spouses or first-degree relatives can consolidate ownership for the application. Once one person receives the Golden Visa, they can sponsor the other owner and dependents.</li>
                <li><b>How can I consolidate ownership?</b> For spouses or first-degree relatives, "gifting" at ADM allows transfer of ownership. This incurs a fixed fee of AED 2,750* rather than the 2% sales transfer fee. Note that NOCs from developers and other entities are still required, with costs similar to a standard transfer. (*Subject to ADM's changes)</li>
                <li><b>Can I combine properties in Abu Dhabi and Dubai for the application?</b> No, properties and applications must be under the same jurisdiction.</li>
                <li><b>Can I apply for the Golden Visa if my property is mortgaged?</b> Yes, as long as the property value minus the outstanding mortgage is over AED 2 million.</li>
                <li>
                    <b>What is the general process for a Golden Visa application?</b>
                    <div>Step 1: Obtain an evaluation certificate from ADM.</div>
                    <div>Step 2: Submit the application in person.</div>

                Investing in rental properties is a rewarding endeavor, but it's no secret—it comes with its own set of challenges. 
                However, fear not! A property management company acts as your ultimate guide, ensuring your investments flourish while you enjoy a worry-free experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's debunk some of the myths surrounding property management that might be holding you back. 
                As your local property management consultants, Transparent is on a mission to unravel these misconceptions and arm you with the insights needed to make wise and informed decisions for your property.
            </p>
            <p><b>Myth 1: Property Management Is Only for Big Properties</b></p>
            <p>
                Don't be misled by the notion that <a style='text-decoration: none' href='https://transparentpm.ae/property-management/'>property management</a> is exclusive to massive property portfolios. 
                Whether you own one unit or a dozen, professional management alleviates stress and skyrockets your investment's profitability.
            </p>
            <p><b>Myth 2: Property Management Companies Are Pricy</b></p>
            <p>
                Contrary to popular belief, professional management is a sound investment. 
                It's not a cost but a strategic move that saves money in the long haul by optimizing income and slashing vacancy rates.
            </p>
            <p><b>Myth 3: I Can Handle Maintenance Myself</b></p>
            <p>
                While DIY seems tempting, property managers leverage networks of reliable professionals, ensuring swift and effective repairs. 
                At Transparent PM, our extensive network secures <a style='text-decoration: none' href='https://transparentpm.ae/property-maintenance/'>cost-effective solutions</a>, saving you time and safeguarding your property's value.
            </p>
            <p><b>Myth 4: Property Managers Are Indifferent</b></p>
            <p>
                Far from it! At Transparent, we're deeply invested in your property's well-being. 
                With roots in the local community, our commitment transcends managing properties—we nurture communities.
            </p>
            <p><b>Myth 5: Rental Property Doesn't Need Management</b></p>
            <p>
                Once leased, it's an ongoing journey. 
                Property management ensures your investment thrives, handling tenant concerns and legal obligations year-round.
            </p>
            <p><b>Myth 6: I Don't Need a Manager for One Property</b></p>
            <p>
                A property manager's expertise is invaluable, even for a single unit. 
                They tackle complexities, letting you relish ownership minus the stress.
            </p>
            <p><b>Myth 7: All Managers Are the Same</b></p>
            <p>
                Not true! Transparent PM stands out with tailored strategies, transparent communication, and years of industry expertise, ensuring your property gets the attention it deserves.
