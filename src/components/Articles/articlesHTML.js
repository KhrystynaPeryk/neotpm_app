                <h3>10 Reasons Why you Really Need a Property Manager in Abu Dhabi</h3>
                <p>
                Owning property is like having a gold mine. It can bring in money without you lifting a finger, especially if you think long-term. But managing that property? 
                That's a full-time job, especially in Abu Dhabi. This is where a  <a style='text-decoration: none' href='https://transparentpm.ae/property-management'> property manager</a> can be your hero.
                </p>
                <p>Here's why:</p>
                <h3>1. Get Your Place Rented Faster:</h3>
                <p>
                Thinking anyone can rent out a property? Many owners simply hope for the best, but time is money. Every vacant week costs you 1.9% of potential return—that's almost 8% in a month! 
                A savvy property manager uses their market knowledge and broad connections to find tenants fast. Choose one who values your property and collaborates with external leasing agents.
                </p>
                <h3>2. Pick the Right Tenants:</h3>
                <p>
                You want tenants who respect your property and pay on time. 
                A seasoned property manager checks potential renters properly and will have procedure in place to minimize risks. This means you're more likely to have tenants who won't give you headaches.
                </p>
                <h3>3. Get Your Rent On Time:</h3>
                <p>
                Chasing rent isn't fun. A property manager takes care of this, ensuring you get your money regularly. If there are delays, they handle it, so you don't have to.
                </p>
                <h3>4. Find Reliable Maintenance Solutions for You:</h3>
                <p>
                In Abu Dhabi, fixing things isn't always a walk in the park. You'll encounter structural issues, the challenge of sourcing parts, and the task of finding trustworthy technicians. Property managers come equipped with a trusted network of technicians and an in-house <a style='text-decoration: none' href='https://transparentpm.ae/property-maintenance'>maintenance team </a> ready to tackle these issues. 
                Having faced many "mysterious maintenance problems" in the past, they handle repairs efficiently. And the best part? You don't have to shoulder the stress of frustrated renters.
                </p>
                <h3>5. Stay On the Right Side of the Law:</h3>
                <p>
                Laws and regulations, especially those related to renting in Abu Dhabi, are frequently changing. It's all too easy to overlook a detail or find yourself stuck, not knowing the next step. (The process of obtaining Tawtheeq, especially for overseas landlords, is a prime example.) 
                Property managers stay current with these updates. Armed with their expertise, they navigate these complexities, ensuring both you and your property remain compliant.
                </p>
                <h3>6. Emergencies? We've Got You Covered:</h3>
                <p>
                It feels like emergencies always strike at the worst times, doesn't it? Whether it's late at night or on a public holiday, unexpected issues like plumbing malfunctions, AC breakdowns, or power outages can arise. 
                But with a property manager on your side, you're shielded from those frantic midnight calls and pressing repairs.
                </p>
                <h3>7. Stay Informed About Your Finances:</h3>
                <p>
                Your property manager provides you with consistent updates on the income and expenses for your property. 
                This clear insight ensures you're always up-to-date on your financial position and saves you time on filing your tax returns.
                </p>
                <h3>8. All Your Paperwork Sorted:</h3>
                <p>
                Managing a property means keeping track of countless details. It's frustrating when you need specific information, like a tenancy agreement, move-in inspection report, or Tawtheeq, and just can't find it. We've seen many owners in this predicament. 
                But with a diligent property manager, all essential documents are organized and ready. When you need something, they've got your back - ensuring you're never left in the lurch.
                </p>
                <h3>9. Stress Reduction:</h3>
                <p>
                Perhaps the most significant benefit is the peace of mind you receive. Knowing that a professional is handling the day-to-day challenges allows you to enjoy the rewards of your investment without the associated stress. 
                Plus, not having to deal with tenants can greatly relieve your stress.
                </p>
                <h3>10. Navigating Difficult Tenants and Situations with Expertise:</h3>
                <p>
                Navigating challenging tenant scenarios or complex rental situations is part of the course for seasoned property managers. 
                With their vast experience, they guide you through potential legal complications and offer efficient resolutions, ensuring minimal disruption. Leveraging their expertise can be instrumental in safeguarding your time, resources, and investment.

                </p>
                <p>
                In conclusion, you can try doing it all on your own, but it won't be easy. Most property owners either lack the know-how or the time. A property manager bridges that gap, ensuring smooth sailing for your property without you having to worry about it. 
                Our advice? Choose a good property manager who is professional, integral, and proactive, and truly understands your property's needs. Trust us, it will be a game-changer for you.

                <h3>Proactive Property Management: 7 Tips for Effective Maintenance in Abu Dhabi </h3>
                <p>
                Few things frustrate tenants more than unresolved maintenance issues. They not only lead to tenancy disputes but also prompt tenants to seek alternative accommodations. 
                These issues cause discomfort for tenants and can be a real headache for you, the landlord. Even with the best intentions, swift resolution of  <a style='text-decoration: none' href='https://transparentpm.ae/property-maintenance'>maintenance problems</a> isn't always guaranteed, and as time goes by, tensions tend to rise.
                </p>
                <p>In this article, we aim to share our insights on effectively handling maintenance issues, especially in the context of Abu Dhabi.</p>
                <h3>1. Expect Maintenance Issues to Occur:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Accepting the Inevitable</b>: Despite our desire for flawless properties, all face maintenance issues. Structural problems arise within the first year, and major AC, water heater, or appliance issues appear around year seven. 
                        Even during the 'honeymoon' period, minor leaks or carpentry issues can arise.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Financial and Mental Readiness</b>: Anticipating maintenance issues at any time allows for financial and mental preparation. 
                        Allocate a maintenance budget, especially as your property ages, and prepare to address urgent issues promptly, fostering positive tenant relationships.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Non-Negotiable Maintenance Responsibilities</b>: If your tenant is experiencing issues related to essential services like AC, clean water, or electricity, you are legally obligated to address these problems, these are non-negotiable. 
                        However, when it comes to cosmetic improvements, the decision is at your discretion.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>2. Choose Ready-Built Properties:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Inspect Before Buying</b>: While discussing buying ready-built properties in a maintenance-focused article may seem unusual, it's crucial. When purchasing off-plan, you can only consider factors like price and location. 
                        However, inspecting a completed property allows you to assess build quality and replacement part accessibility, preventing future issues.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Avoiding Structural Issues</b>: Structural problems, like foundation issues or burst pipes within walls, are the most challenging. As an individual landlord, resolving these is daunting, expensive, causing frustration while tenants grow impatient. 
                        Purchasing properties with existing occupants allows for physical assessments to prevent future maintenance headaches.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>3. Regular Inspection and Preventative Maintenance:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b> Scheduled Inspections</b>: Regular inspections, coupled with a preventative maintenance plan, enable the identification of potential issues before they escalate into major problems. This includes checking AC systems, electrical components, unblocking drainage, and pest control. 
                        Addressing minor issues promptly can prevent them from evolving into major concerns.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b> Preventing Tenant Negligence Issues</b>: Not all tenants report maintenance issues promptly. Some may overlook problems until they move out, by which time it's often too late. 
                        Regular inspections increase the likelihood of identifying and addressing these issues before they escalate.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>4. Transparent Communication with Tenants:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Streamlined Maintenance Reporting</b>: Establishing a clear process for tenants to report maintenance issues and ensuring they know how to contact you is essential. 
                        Though it adds up to your work load, encourage tenants to report even minor issues to prevent hidden problems.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Timely Responses</b>: Respond promptly to maintenance requests, even if it's just to acknowledge receipt. Setting clear repair timelines instills confidence in the tenant that the issue will be resolved promptly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Keeping Tenants Informed</b>: Regularly update tenants on the progress of repairs to foster trust and satisfaction. Transparency helps tenants understand when they can expect resolution.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>5. Qualified Contractors:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Choose Experienced Contractors Wisely</b>: Finding skilled and dependable contractors is already a challenge, and in Abu Dhabi, you also need to consider their familiarity with your specific complexes. This insider knowledge can be invaluable, as it often contains know-how not found in maintenance textbooks but will nonetheless make or break your maintenance projects. 
                        Price is not the only consideration in Abu Dhabi.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>6. Find a Good Tenant:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Your Tenant Makes or Breaks Your Property</b>: A good tenant minimizes maintenance work and boosts property popularity for re-renting, while a bad tenant can lead to significant issues. 
                        For instance, one of our clients faced tenant troubles when their tenant ran off and even stole a water pump from his villa.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>7. Handling Time-Consuming Maintenance Issues:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Unraveling Maintenance Mysteries</b>: While 80% of maintenance issues have straightforward solutions, the remaining 20% can be puzzling. 
                        Solving them demands a meticulous examination of every factor and often requires extensive investigation and collaboration with multiple parties to pinpoint the source of the problem.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Appliance Maintenance Challenges</b>: Repairs, regardless of the brand, are often time-consuming due to infrequent service visits from Dubai-based companies, resulting in delays and costs. 
                        Consider dedicating the necessary effort and time for repairs (and prepare your tenant for this), or opt for a simpler solution by replacing appliances every few years.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class='quote'>

        <div><i style='color: gray'>October 4, 2023</i></div>
        <div class='article-body'>
            <p>
                We are in the field of Abu Dhabi Property Management long enough to encounter many landlords seeking assistance with tenant disputes. 
                Mediating conflicts between landlords and tenants is a daily part of our routine, and we understand the unique challenges that come with it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Very often we'd hear one party threaten to take legal action, if their demands are not met, and the other party would quickly respond with, "Bring it on, let's go to court."
            </p>
            <p>
                It seems like going to court is the only solution for tenancy disputes.
            </p>
            <p>
                But as any experienced property manager would know, court proceedings are pricy, time consuming and may or may not yield much financial benefits. It should be treated as the last resort not the first.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this article, we'll discuss the proper ways to amicably settle disagreements with your tenants without resorting to court (or the rental dispute council) to mitigate your financial losses.
            </p>
            <h3>1. Prevention is Always Better Than a Solution</h3>
            <p>
                It may sound cliché, but it still holds true in  <a style='text-decoration: none' href='https://transparentpm.ae/property-management'>property management</a>. By taking the following steps, you can reduce the chances of encountering disputes with your tenants significantly.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Screen Your Tenants</b>: Your property is one of your most valuable assets. A good tenant can enhance it, while a troublesome one can cause significant financial and time losses. 
                    Screen your tenants carefully to avoid such issues.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Detailed Tenancy Contracts</b>: A comprehensive tenancy agreement is essential. It serves as a guiding principle for conflict resolution and clarifies tenant responsibilities and landlord rights. 
                    Don't leave room for dispute by opting for simple green tenancy contract.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Payment Mechanisms</b>: While many landlords accept monthly payments, it can be a risky move. Late or unpaid rent is a common cause of disputes. 
                    Limiting payments to quarterly or annually can reduce your risk and stress.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Build Trusting Relationships</b>: Establishing a good, trusting relationship with your tenants from the start can go a long way. 
                    It's natural to be kind to those who reciprocate, and positive relationships can prevent conflicts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Tawtheeq Matters</b>: Make sure you issue your tenants the Tawtheeq and understand the terms in it. In Abu Dhabi, without a valid Tawtheeq, you cannot proceed with any legal assistance. 
                    And judges often judge based on terms in accordance with Tawtheeq.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Don't Fear Non-Renewal</b>: If tenants show signs of incorporation, consider not renewing their leases. The longer they stay, the more likely they cause more headaches.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2. Quick Solutions to Maintenance Problems</h3>
            <p>
                <a style='text-decoration: none' href='https://transparentpm.ae/property-maintenance'>Maintenance issues</a> are often underestimated by landlords. Disagreements about maintenance and liability are another major source of tenancy dispute. Find tenants that will look after your place. 
                Embrace tenant-reported maintenance requests as opportunities to maintain property quality and act on tenants' requests quickly if it's under your responsibility.
            </p>
            <h3>3. Resolving Tenancy Disputes Amicably</h3>
            <p>
                Before considering legal action, it's essential to attempt amicable resolution:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Stay Impartial</b>: In any dispute, impartiality is crucial. Try to understand the tenant's perspective and concerns, even if you believe you are 100% at the right. 
                    Delve deep to uncover the root cause before jumping to conclusions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Be Rational</b>: Avoid impulsive decisions. Whether you opt for negotiation or the legal route, make a well-considered choice. 
                    Understand your risks, costs, benefits, motives, objectives and chances of winning, if you do decide to take legal action. Parties often underestimate the time and financial requirements, including lawyer's fees, and overestimate their financial gain before pursuing legal action.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Compromise</b>: Negotiation involves give and take. Identify what matters most to both you and your tenant, and propose a compromised solution to settle the case between parties.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Appeal to Tenants' Conscience</b>: Encourage tenants to act in good faith by highlighting the importance of a harmonious landlord-tenant relationship.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Seek a Mediator</b>: If you feel you've reached an impasse, consider involving a mediator. 
                    Bringing in a neutral third party, such as a friend or a property manager, can offer fresh perspectives and potentially unlock solutions to the situation.
                </li>
            </ul>

            </p>
            <h3>4. Filing a Case at the Rental Dispute Council</h3>
            <p>
                When all else fails, and legal action becomes necessary, you can file a case at the Rental Dispute Council:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Prepare Your Petition</b>: Your might need a lawyer to help you prepare it for submitting to the council.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Visiting the Rental Dispute Council:</b>: Visit the council in person or through your Power of Attorney (preferably someone fluent in Arabic). 
                    Complete the complaint form, pay the required fees (usually 4% of annual rent, capped at AED 10,000, plus additional fees if needed), and receive a date for the first case session.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                In my time at TPM, I've seen many property owners, mostly from overseas, grapple with the intricacies of departing the UAE. 
                If you're on the brink of bidding Abu Dhabi adieu, either temporarily or permanently, here's a distilled guide to manage your property seamlessly.
            </p>
            <p>
                A. Prior to Resigning, Equip Yourself with These Insights:
            </p>
            <h3>1. The Golden Visa Quest</h3>
            <p>
                Certain Golden Visa categories need an employment certificate for validation. If you're eligible, begin the application before your resignation. 
                This not only retains your UAE residency but also streamlines future property-related dealings.
            </p>
        
            <h3>2. The Re-mortgage Consideration</h3>
            <p>
                Considering a mortgage? Address it pre-resignation. Banks insist on employment certificates. 
                Once you're overseas, your negotiation leverage with banks diminishes.
            </p>
            <h3>3. Diversify Bank Accounts</h3>
            <p>
                If your primary account is linked to a mortgage, open an additional one. 
                Banks might sometimes freeze accounts of those leaving the UAE. Being prepared is prudent.
            </p>
            <h3>4. Stay EMID Updated</h3>
            <p>
                With a Golden Visa or EMID, keep your details updated across banks and service providers. 
                It's about ensuring a continuous service experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                B. Essentials to Tackle Before Departure:
            </p>
            <h3>5. Activate Your UAE Pass </h3>
            <p>
                Handle this while in the UAE. Retain your activation phone; It's essential for seamless UAE Pass operations from abroad. 
                If you encounter any issues, refrain from adjusting any settings without expert guidance.
            </p>
            <h3>6. Property Decisions: Sell or Rent?</h3>
            <p>
                Selling can be a slow burn. If your property is jointly owned, it's wise to have a shared local bank account. 
                Considering a contingency plan, like enlisting <a style='text-decoration: none' href='https://transparentpm.ae/articles/10-reasons-why-you-really-need-a-property-manager-in-abu-dhabi'>a property manager</a> or securing <a style='text-decoration: none' href='https://transparentpm.ae/owner-support/power-of-attorney'>a POA</a>, is invaluable.
            </p>
            <div style='display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center'>
                <img src=${article4BodyImg1} class='article-img' alt='property-manager-tips' loading="lazy"/>
                <div class='img-caption' style='margin-top: 0.5em'><a style='text-decoration: none; color: gray' href='https://transparentpm.ae/'>www.transparentpm.ae</a></div>
            </div>
            <h3>7. Tawtheeq Management </h3>
            <p>
                Maintain it under your name or a trusted manager's.
                Challenges arise when developers discontinue their Tawtheeq services, and tackling this from overseas can be intricate.
            </p>
            <h3>8. Settle Debts </h3>
            <p>
                Clear all outstanding bills. Leave behind only memories, not dues.
            </p>
            <h3>9. Vehicle Matters </h3>
            <p>
                Decide between selling or exporting your vehicle before your residency concludes.
            </p>
            <h3>10. Stamped IBAN Letter </h3>
            <p>
                Seems small, but for those renting to government personnel, it's indispensable.
            </p>

                "Maintain the Tawtheeq under your name or a trusted manager's. Challenges arise when developers discontinue their Tawtheeq services, and tackling this from overseas can be intricate."
            </p>
            <h3>11. Handling Rental Cheques and Tenancy Issues  </h3>
            <p>
                Keep communication channels open with tenants. Make sure you have means to continue receiving rent or to deposit rental cheques, addressing <a style='text-decoration: none' href='https://transparentpm.ae/property-maintenance'>maintenance</a> issues and renewals.
            </p>
            <h3>12. Re-evaluate Property Insurance </h3>
            <p>
                Review your policy. Ensure it remains intact once you're no longer UAE-based. 
                You might be surprised many insurance providers don't extend their coverage to non-residential property owners.
            </p>
            <h3>13. Departure Dynamics </h3>
            <p>
                If you're on a tight schedule, getting professional help, either via a POA or a property manager, is a strategic move.
            </p>
            <h3>14. Trusted Property Managers </h3>
            <p>
                When leaving, an experienced, trustworthy property manager is worth their weight in gold. Choose wisely.
            </p>
            <h3>15. The POA Advantage</h3>
            <p>
                Even if you're not rushing, <a style='text-decoration: none' href='https://transparentpm.ae/owner-support/power-of-attorney'>a local POA</a> is a great asset. Understand the nuances based on your nationality and visa requirements.

            <p>
                While many emphasize the importance of "<b>location, location, location</b>" in real estate, the truth is that there's a world of considerations beyond this mantra.
            </p>
            <p>
                The UAE's property market is not just thriving; it's a global beacon of safety and luxury, attracting investors from all corners of the world. 
                As <a style='text-decoration: none' href='https://transparentpm.ae/articles/10-reasons-why-you-really-need-a-property-manager-in-abu-dhabi'>a property manager</a> in this thriving market, we've witnessed properties evolve throughout their lifecycles, granting us unique insights that often elude sales and leasing agents.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, we're here to provide you with a property manager's perspective on the pivotal factors to consider when making a real estate investment - factors that go far beyond the obvious elements of location, price, and rental returns.
            </p>
            <h3>1. The Foundation of Your Investment - Build Quality Matters</h3>
            <p>
                When you're stepping into the realm of real estate, the foundation is everything. It's not just about four walls and a roof; it's about the quality of those walls and the integrity of that roof. Common issues like waterproofing is not pleasant but can still be dealt with effectively. However, some problems are more insidious, like foundation issues. 
                That's often beyond the capability of individual property owners. If you're eyeing a villa, take the time to explore the community. Watch for signs of landslides or cracks in exterior walls.
            </p>
    
            <h3>2. Community Management's Impact on Your Investment</h3>
            <p>
                Real estate isn't just a transaction; it's a long-term commitment. 
                Many buyers don't consider, but the quality of community <a style='text-decoration: none' href='https://transparentpm.ae/property-management'>management</a> is a pivotal factor that can significantly impact your property's value.  A reputable community manager can enhance your investment, while a lackluster one can erode it.
                <p>When evaluating community management, consider the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Assess the reputation of the community manager and their track record with other projects.</li>
                    <li>Scrutinize the service charge collection rate. A community can't be effectively managed if a substantial number of owners default on their service charge payments. Stay away from those with high default rates.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>3. Balancing Uniqueness and Maintenance Costs - The Price of Unique Design</h3>
            <p>
                In the pursuit of your real estate dreams, you might be drawn to properties with unique features. They stand out, grab your attention, and promise to set your investment apart. However, unique designs often come with a price tag. 
                They usually require more frequent <a style='text-decoration: none' href='https://transparentpm.ae/articles/7-tips-for-effective-maintenance-in-abu-dhabi'>maintenance</a>, harder to find qualified technicians and can be significantly more costly to replace any defective parts. 
                As you consider such properties, ensure you factor in potential <a style='text-decoration: none' href='https://transparentpm.ae/property-maintenance'>maintenance costs</a> - uniqueness should enhance your investment, not drain it.

            <h3>4. Beyond Handover - Your Ongoing Relationship with Developers - Developer Commitment Post-Purchase</h3>
            <p>
                Your relationship with a property developer doesn't end with the handover. A real estate investment is a long-term endeavor, and you'll likely have ongoing interactions with the developer for matters such as the defect liability period (DLP), sales transfers, or addressing major issues. It's about responsiveness, reliability, and resolving issues that crop up, and developers' commitment post-purchase can make all the difference. 
                Conduct thorough research into the developer's reputation for post-purchase customer service to avoid unpleasant surprises. Buying from a developer who cares after you make your purchase would really save you a lot of headaches down the road.
            </p>
            <h3>5. Navigating the Excitement of Off-Plan Projects - The Off-Plan Risk Equation</h3>
            <p>
                While investor enthusiasm for off-plan projects is often sky-high, it's crucial not to overlook the associated risks. Since you can't physically inspect the property, your investment relies on research and analysis. 
                In addition to seeking information about build quality, community management, and unique designs, you must answer three critical questions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>How confident are you that the project will be completed on time? What's the likelihood of project delays or worst-case scenario, being completely stalled?</li>
                <li>What is the developer's cash flow stability, and how likely are they to encounter financial difficulties before project completion?</li>
                <li>Is there a contingency plan in case the project cannot be delivered as promised, to safeguard your investment?</li>
            </ul>
            <p class='quote'>

            </p>
            <p>
                Scrutinize the developer's financial reports as if you were evaluating a company's stock for investment.
            </p>
            <p>
                And don't be afraid to approach owners who bought from the same developer previously, or someone who knows real estate well but is impartial to your purchasing decision—like us, property managers, who don't have a stake in your real estate purchasing decision.
            </p>
            <p>
                Remember, your real estate investment is substantial, and in-depth research is time well spent.

            <p>
                The UAE offers convenient virtual <a style='text-decoration: none' href='https://transparentpm.ae/owner-support/power-of-attorney'>Power of Attorney</a> (POA) attestation services. However, in some situations, the online route may not be feasible, and the embassy route becomes necessary.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is especially relevant if you require a POA before your properties receive their title deeds. Such a need is common if you require assistance with property handover, applying for title deeds, or managing properties where title deeds are not available. 
                In these cases, it's impossible to have the POA done either through virtual attestation or a physical visit to a notary public.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, what's the solution?
            </p>
            <p>
                The answer is to have it attested overseas.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this article, I will outline the procedure for overseas attestation.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Step 1</b>: Appoint a POA in the UAE
            </p>
            <p>
                Finding a trustworthy individual with the knowledge to assist with the POA procedure in the UAE is crucial. This person should be capable of completing the tasks you assign.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Step 2</b>: Draft the POA
            </p>
            <p>
                A highly critical step. Many reasons can make a POA fail to work. Make sure the one you got is bullet-proof and is guaranteed to work
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>[In your Residing Country]</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Step 3</b>: In your residing country, all principals should sign the POA in the presence of a notary public.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Step 4</b>: Get the POA document attested by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in your residing country. This process is also known as legalization or apostille. 
                (For UK residents, some clients have used this <a href='https://www.apostille.org.uk/'>company</a> for assistance with the legalization process.)
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Step 5</b>: Have the POA certified by the UAE embassy or consulate in your residing country.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Step 6</b>: Courier the legalized and certified POA document to the UAE, and have your appointed POA assist with the subsequent steps.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>[In UAE]</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Step 7</b>: Get the POA stamped by the UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Step 8</b>: Have the POA translated into Arabic by a licensed translator.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Step 9</b>: Have the POA certified by the UAE Ministry of Justice online through the UAE Pass.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>

            </p>
            <p>
                Regardless of the method used for attesting the POA, drafting it accurately is a critical step. The effectiveness of your POA largely depends on the quality of the draft. Law firms, translation companies, and notary publics can draft the POA for you. However, it's highly recommended to go for companies with actual experiences using POAs for the specific transaction you intend to undertake. 
                There are too many reasons why a POA can be rejected by the authority.

                Since the introduction of the golden visa scheme in 2019, hundreds of thousands of applications have been submitted. 
                Among all categories, the golden visa application through property investment has been most enticing to foreign investors. 
                It offers an excellent opportunity to own an asset in the UAE while securing a 10-year residency.

                As many know, there are significant differences between these two emirates, as is likely the case with all emirates.
            </p>
            <p>
                Below, I answer several common questions our clients ask about the application process.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>FAQ:</b>
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Do I qualify for a Property Golden Visa Application?</b> You qualify if you own one or more properties in Abu Dhabi with a combined value of at least 2 million dirhams.</li>
                <li><b>Is the property value the same as my purchase price?</b> No, it's based on the current market value, not the original purchase price.</li>
                <li><b>How do I know if my properties meet the 2 million dirhams requirement?</b> The true value is confirmed once you receive an evaluation certificate from Abu Dhabi Municipality. The cost for each certificate is AED 1,053, and each property requires its own certificate.</li>
                <li>
                    <b>How can I estimate the market value of my property?</b> There are several methods, such as checking PropertyFinder for average sales prices. 
                    However, remember these figures are based on advertised, not actual, transaction prices. Real estate agents with recent local transactions can provide insights.
                    Or our favorite is DARI's portal (<a href='https://www.dari.ae/'>www.dari.ae</a>) to check the real transactions value. <b>Log into Dari using your UAE Pass</b> and search for market data. 
                    You can then filter by location, community, and property type. This should provide a graph similar to the one below, displaying the total number of transactions per quarter and the total sales value. To estimate the sales price per transaction, simply perform this calculation: (total sales value) /(total transaction count) = Averaged transaction price.
                </li>

                </div>
                <li><b>If my property is jointly owned, can both owners apply for the Golden Visa?</b> Yes, but the property's minimum value must be AED 2 million per owner. So, a property owned by two people must be worth at least AED 4 million.</li>
                <li><b>What if my jointly owned property doesn't meet the AED 2 million requirement per owner?</b> Spouses or first-degree relatives can consolidate ownership for the application. Once one person receives the Golden Visa, they can sponsor the other owner and dependents.</li>
                <li><b>How can I consolidate ownership?</b> For spouses or first-degree relatives, "gifting" at ADM allows transfer of ownership. This incurs a fixed fee of AED 2,750* rather than the 2% sales transfer fee. Note that NOCs from developers and other entities are still required, with costs similar to a standard transfer. (*Subject to ADM's changes)</li>
                <li><b>Can I combine properties in Abu Dhabi and Dubai for the application?</b> No, properties and applications must be under the same jurisdiction.</li>
                <li><b>Can I apply for the Golden Visa if my property is mortgaged?</b> Yes, as long as the property value minus the outstanding mortgage is over AED 2 million.</li>
                <li>
                    <b>What is the general process for a Golden Visa application?</b>
                    <div>Step 1: Obtain an evaluation certificate from ADM.</div>
                    <div>Step 2: Submit the application in person.</div>
                    <div>Step 3: Receive approval.</div>

            </p>
            <p>
                Let's debunk some of the myths surrounding property management that might be holding you back. 
                As your local property management consultants, Transparent is on a mission to unravel these misconceptions and arm you with the insights needed to make wise and informed decisions for your property.
            </p>
            <p><b>Myth 1: Property Management Is Only for Big Properties</b></p>
            <p>
                Don't be misled by the notion that <a style='text-decoration: none' href='https://transparentpm.ae/property-management/'>property management</a> is exclusive to massive property portfolios. 
                Whether you own one unit or a dozen, professional management alleviates stress and skyrockets your investment's profitability.
            </p>
            <p><b>Myth 2: Property Management Companies Are Pricy</b></p>
            <p>
                Contrary to popular belief, professional management is a sound investment. 
                It's not a cost but a strategic move that saves money in the long haul by optimizing income and slashing vacancy rates.
            </p>
            <p><b>Myth 3: I Can Handle Maintenance Myself</b></p>
            <p>
                While DIY seems tempting, property managers leverage networks of reliable professionals, ensuring swift and effective repairs. 
                At Transparent PM, our extensive network secures <a style='text-decoration: none' href='https://transparentpm.ae/property-maintenance/'>cost-effective solutions</a>, saving you time and safeguarding your property's value.
            </p>
            <p><b>Myth 4: Property Managers Are Indifferent</b></p>
            <p>
                Far from it! At Transparent, we're deeply invested in your property's well-being. 
                With roots in the local community, our commitment transcends managing properties—we nurture communities.
            </p>
            <p><b>Myth 5: Rental Property Doesn't Need Management</b></p>
            <p>
                Once leased, it's an ongoing journey. 
                Property management ensures your investment thrives, handling tenant concerns and legal obligations year-round.
            </p>
            <p><b>Myth 6: I Don't Need a Manager for One Property</b></p>
            <p>
                A property manager's expertise is invaluable, even for a single unit. 
                They tackle complexities, letting you relish ownership minus the stress.
            </p>
            <p><b>Myth 7: All Managers Are the Same</b></p>
            <p>
                Not true! Transparent PM stands out with tailored strategies, transparent communication, and years of industry expertise, ensuring your property gets the attention it deserves.

        <div><i style='color: gray'>November 27, 2023</i></div>
        <div class='article-body'>
            <p>
                Recently, we assisted an overseas client who wanted us to act as his <a style='text-decoration: none' href='https://transparentpm.ae/owner-support/power-of-attorney'>Power of Attorney</a> (POA) for purchasing a property in Abu Dhabi. 
                While drafting the document, he inquired whether the POA was still necessary after completing the sales transfer.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's a good question.
            </p>
            <p>
                We often take for granted the things we can do locally. 
                For overseas owners, however, everything can be more challenging.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, if you are an overseas owner, how can a POA assist you?
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> 
                    <b>Handover/Sales/Purchase Assistance</b>:
                    If property owners cannot travel to the UAE to sign documents for handover and receive the keys, a POA can do it on their behalf.
                </li>
                <li> 
                    <b>ADDC Liaison</b>:
                    For tasks like registering utility accounts, updating ownership information, or dealing with tenants who refuse to close their own ADDC accounts, a POA - and strictly a POA (as ADDC has become very strict) - can assist.
                </li>
                <li> 
                    <b>Continuity in Issuing Tawtheeq</b>:
                    Many owners lose their UAE phone number after leaving the UAE, making it difficult to access their UAE pass to issue tawtheeq. However, having a local POA can bypass this issue, ensuring continuous issuance of your tawtheeq.
                </li>
                <li> 
                    <b>Receiving Rent from Governmental Entities</b>:
                    Some government agencies pay rent directly to the landlord's UAE bank account. 
                    This isn't usually a problem for local owners, but it can be difficult for overseas owners, especially if they don't have local bank accounts. 
                    A local POA can resolve this issue.
                </li>
                <li> 
                    <b>Complying with Government Requirements</b>:
                    When the government introduces changes to property ownership or legal requirements, having a POA in town means your POA can immediately assist you with compliance.
                </li>
                <li> 
                    <b>Legal Representation</b>:
                    In case of any disputes, your POA can represent you in court.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div style='display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center'>

            <p>
                <b>Limitations of a POA in the UAE:</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                It might seem obvious, but there are situations in the UAE where a POA offers no benefits:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> 
                    <b>Fingerprint Requirements</b>:
                    In many cases where the owner's fingerprints are required (like verifying your UAE pass or canceling or registering telecom accounts), a POA is limited.
                </li>
                <li> 
                    <b>Signing Mortgage Documents</b>:
                    Most banks require the loan applicant to physically sign mortgage documents in their presence. 
                    A POA cannot assist with this.
                </li>
                <li> 
                    <b>Opening Bank Accounts</b>:
                    Similarly, a POA cannot open bank accounts on your behalf.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <b>Things to Watch Out for When Making a POA:</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> 
                    <b>Trustworthiness</b>:
                    The most crucial factor in choosing a POA is trustworthiness.
                </li>
                <li> 
                    <b>Professional Knowledge</b>:
                    You want your POA to take care of things for you. 
                    Your POA should have the necessary professional knowledge for the tasks they are required to do.
                </li>
                <li> 
                    <b>Scope and Duration</b>:
                    Carefully read the scope and duration of the POA to control the power you delegate.
                </li>
                <li> 
                    <b>Drafting and Testing the POA</b>:
                    Ensure the POA draft has been thoroughly tested, so you are confident your POA can execute tasks successfully under the attested POA.
                </li>
                <li> 
                    <b>General vs. Special POA</b>:
                    Consider whether you need a General POA or a Special POA. A Special POA is property-specific and offers more protection, but a General POA might be necessary for maximum flexibility.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>

            <p>
                I believe the answer is 'yes,' at least until we encounter the "reality check" accompanying the handover of off-plan properties. 
                Only then will we truly understand whether the Abu Dhabi market can sustain itself or will need to undergo a level of correction.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2022 and 2023, Abu Dhabi's property market experienced significant growth. 
                The Property Finder Annual Market Watch 2023 report, citing the Department of Municipalities and Transport (DMT), revealed a record high in transactions, with 13,298 in a year, compared to 7,957 in 2022. 
                This reflects a substantial 75% increase, of which 97% were residential transactions. 
                The total transaction value also soared to AED 44 billion, marking a remarkable 120% increase from 2022's AED 19.9 billion, with 85% of this value attributed to residential properties.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, with strong predictions of economic growth in 2024 (the UAE Central Bank forecasts a rise of up to 4.3% for 2024, and the IMF expects the UAE's GDP to grow by 4% in the same year), and considering the regional turmoil globally, the UAE's market appears more favorable. 
                Oil prices have stabilized, and further loosening of restrictions in oil production is expected. 
                Thus, the property market outlook for Abu Dhabi in 2024 remains optimistic.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>But will the prices continue to rise, and for how much longer? What should we watch out for? 
                Is what I want to explore in this article.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>1. Delayed Reality Check: </b>: Since the onset of Covid in 2020, Abu Dhabi's real estate market has seen a surge, particularly in off-plan properties. In 2023, 76% of sales transactions were from off-plan properties. For investors not planning to occupy these properties themselves, assessing achievable rental prices will be critical. 
                But with off-plan projects, there will always be a delay in answering the most crucial question to all property investors: <i>how much rent can these off-plan properties command when they are finally handed over?</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                Considering many off-plan projects in Abu Dhabi's asking price can be as high as 50% more than their neighboring properties per sqf, there is a question of whether there will be strong enough rental demand to support the high asking prices of off-plan properties. 
                We will gain more insight as the market heads towards a handover boom from 2025 onwards.

            </div>
            <p> 
                <b>2. Population Growth: </b>In comparison to Dubai, which saw its population grow by nearly 1 million from 2013 to 2023, reaching a current level of 3,051,000, Abu Dhabi's population growth has been more moderate, currently reaching nearly 1.6 million. 
                Between 2022 and 2023, the population increased by 27,000. Stronger population growth would provide more robust support for the real estate market, significantly impacting the duration of this property expansion cycle.
            </p>
            <p> 
                <b>3. Reliance on Oil, Even for Non-Oil Sectors: </b>Anyone involved in Abu Dhabi's real estate market in 2015 will vividly remember the "oil recession," when the market plummeted, losing about 10% in property prices each year from 2015 onwards. 
                Many properties saw their rental and sales prices halved during this recession. While the government is certainly moving in the right direction by diversifying the economy, it's important to pay attention to whether the non-oil industries are actually funded by oil revenue or benefit from it. 
                For instance, technically, real estate is a non-oil industry, but when oil prices affect nearly all companies' revenues and their staff's ability to rent properties, oil prices alone can greatly affect the real estate market.
            </p>
            <p> 
                <b>4. Potential Hyper Supply Phase: </b>Viewing real estate investment as a cycle through recovery, expansion, hyper supply, and recession phases, 2023 is undoubtedly a year of expansion. 
                The critical question is how long this expansion phase will last, or whether we are approaching a hyper supply phase. 
                It might still be a bit too early to judge, but clearly understanding the current phase of the cycle and anticipating future trends is crucial for adopting effective strategies and ensuring profitable investments.

                As a final point, you can make money from real estate in different cycle, but understanding where we are and the potential risks and outlook can help you prepare and tailor your real estate strategy to increase your odds of success.

                The Abu Dhabi property market is gaining momentum, and with numerous properties nearing handover, you, as a property owner, might be anticipating the next steps. To secure the best rental price, it's essential to be among the earliest to receive your property, especially before similar ones hit the market. 
                While I can't promise that the process will be quick or simple, understanding and methodically following the necessary steps will definitely ease your journey to property ownership.

                Are you eagerly awaiting the handover of your property in Abu Dhabi?
            </p>
            <p>
                The bustling property market is reaching new heights, and being proactive in the handover process can ensure you secure the best rental price for your property. 
                To guide you through this exciting journey, we've outlined 10 essential steps for a seamless handover experience.
            </p>
            <p> 
                <b>1. Claim All Your Perks: </b>Before the handover, make sure your property is fully paid, and all agreed-upon perks, rebates, and discounts are considered. 
                Clear communication is key to keeping everyone involved on the same page.
            </p>
            <p> 
                <b>2. Engage a Financial Broker: </b>Secure favorable mortgage rates by engaging a reliable financial broker. 
                Beyond financing, consider the bank's customer service quality, as this relationship extends beyond the handover.
            </p>
            <p> 
                <b>3. Pre-handover Snagging: </b>Take advantage of our free 1-hour snagging service for the first 5 property owners. 
                Identifying and addressing defects before handover is crucial to avoid challenges during the warranty period.
            </p>
            <p> 
                <b>4. Settle Full Payment & First Year Service Charge: </b>Understand the developer's terms regarding the first year's service charges. 
                Complying with these terms is essential to proceed with the handover.
            </p>
            <p> 
                <b>5. Receive Your Title Deed: </b>Obtain your title deed by checking with your developer for specific guidance and any necessary fees. This step varies, so stay informed.
            </p>
            <p> 
                <b>6. Change ADDC Ownership Name: </b>Request a NOC from the developer post-financial settlement to change the property's ownership name with ADDC. Be prepared for potential delays from ADDC.
            </p>
            <p> 
                <b>7. Handover Appointment: </b>Schedule a key handover appointment with the developer. 
                Be ready to sign additional agreements such as the Master Community Rule and Facility Management Agreement.
            </p>
            <p> 
                <b>8. Set Up Chilled Water & Gas Account: </b>Verify the specific requirements for your property type with your developer. This step varies, so ensure compliance.
            </p>
            <p> 
                <b>9. Register Property's Tawtheeq under Your UAE Pass: </b>Essential for renting out your property, register your property's Tawtheeq under your UAE Pass. Non-residents or those without an Emirates ID may require assistance.
            </p>
            <p> 
                <b>10. De-snag: </b>After initial snagging, conduct thorough de-snagging checks to ensure all reported issues are rectified before occupancy.

                Last week, we summarized ValuStrat's report on Abu Dhabi's market in 2023. This week, we would like to compare Abu Dhabi and Dubai.
            </p>
            <p><b>1. Overview</b></p>
            <p>
                In 2023, both Abu Dhabi and Dubai's real estate markets showcased resilience and growth, albeit with distinct characteristics. 
                Abu Dhabi maintained steady progress with a focus on sustainability and strategic expansion, while Dubai experienced robust demand and dynamic growth, driven by its economic diversification efforts and strategic infrastructural developments.
            </p>

            </ul>
            <p><b>4. Hospitality and Tourism</b></p>
            <p>
                Both emirates experienced growth in their hospitality sectors, with increasing occupancy rates, average daily rates (ADR), and revenue per available room (RevPAR). 
                Dubai, in particular, saw a surge in international guests, underlining its status as a premier global tourist destination.
            </p>
            <p><b>5. Economic Indicators</b></p>
            <p>
                The economic outlook for both emirates remains positive, with projections indicating continued growth. 
                The UAE's strategic initiatives, including visa reforms and investment in infrastructure, are expected to further boost economic activity and attract foreign investment.
            </p>
            <p><b>6. Key Takeaways</b></p>
            <p>
                <b>Abu Dhabi:</b> The emirate's real estate market is characterized by steady growth, with a focus on sustainability and strategic expansion. 
                The government's initiatives to diversify the economy away from oil are expected to support the real estate sector's continued growth.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Dubai:</b> Exhibits dynamic growth driven by strong demand, significant capital value increases, and a robust tourism sector. 
                Dubai's strategic infrastructural developments and economic diversification efforts are key drivers of its real estate market's performance.

            <p>
                In conclusion, both Abu Dhabi and Dubai exhibited growth in their real estate markets in 2023, though the nature and scale of this growth varied. 
                Dubai's market saw more significant increases in residential capital and rental values, driven by strong demand and strategic developments. 
                In contrast, Abu Dhabi's growth was more moderate, with a focus on sustainability and strategic economic diversification
            </p>
            <p>
                Both emirates are poised for continued growth, underpinned by positive economic indicators and strategic initiatives aimed at attracting foreign investment and boosting economic activity. 
                We believe the market will continue to grow in the near future in both emirates, but both markets should be closely monitored as off-plan units are handed over. 
                This will determine whether there is sufficient demand to sustain this growth.

        <div class='article-body'>
            <p>
                Recently, my team and I experienced a bit of a rollercoaster with a tenant who has been with us for a hefty six years. 
                It's funny how time flies, but some challenges just stick with you, don't they? 
                Every single rental payment with this tenant turned into a mini-drama, culminating in the peak moment before the finale: settling the security deposit and maintenance deductions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The amount of effort, time, emotion, and brainpower that went into settling issues with one troublesome tenant really made me reflect on the commonalities among the "bad tenants" we've encountered in our company. 
                Apart from a salary certificate, can we become more attuned to those "not-so-obvious" 🚩red flags before handing over the keys?
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's dive into some friendly advice, gathered from our own bumps along the property management road, on how to spot a potential misfit tenant—because, let's face it, a happy tenant-landlord relationship is what we're all after!
            </p>
            <p>
                1. <b>Promises, Promises: </b>
                Ever dealt with someone who's all talk but no action? If so, it's best to immediately cut that offer off. 
                There's a good chance the person is unreliable, making everything ten times harder to handle.
            </p>
            <p>
                2. <b>"It's a Matter of Principle": </b>
                Seriously, when anyone says that, what it truly means is it's either my way or no way. 
                Often, their "principle" even surpasses black and white contracts, making it impossible to come to terms.
            </p>
            <p>
                3. <b>"Trust Me, I'm...": </b>
                What I've realized is that truly trustworthy people don't say such things; they just do. 
                Only those who are unreliable try to convince you of how integral and trustworthy they are with their words.
            </p>
            <p>
                4. <b>The Blame Game: </b>
                With these kinds of people, even if you confront them with their own signed contract, they would still argue that they were forced to sign it. 
                It's always someone else's fault but theirs. It's safe to assume your property won't be in safe hands with someone who cannot even own up to their behavior. 
                Better to part ways sooner rather than later.
            </p>
            <div style='display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center'>
                <img src=${article13BodyImg1} class='article-img' alt='colleagues' loading="lazy"/>

            </div>
            <p>
                5. <b>Unwilling to Cooperate: </b>
                If someone is difficult to deal with during the happy time of signing up for a new property, the chances that the relationship will go sour when we have to settle the security deposit during the move-out is very high.
            </p>
            <p>
                6. <b>“I will call the police”: </b>
                I agree that there will be disputes requiring resolution through police intervention or courts, but that should be a last resort. 
                Anyone who spits out threats so casually is likely to be highly emotional and lack the ability to resolve problems through negotiation or discourse. 
                They can be tiring to deal with.
            </p>
            <p>
                7. <b>Loopholes of Laws: </b>
                It's good to have knowledge of the law, but knowing how to circumvent the law is a different thing. 
                Be mindful of such people; if they have the knowledge plus any sign of untrustworthiness, it's better to steer clear of them.
            </p>
            <p>
                8. <b>Nationality Matters: </b>
                People from different nations have communication styles they are accustomed to. Intercultural communication isn't always easy. 
                If you tend to misunderstand certain nationalities or feel dread when dealing with behaviors from certain nationalities, then it's better to avoid them.
            </p>
            <p class='quote'>
                What I've realized is that truly trustworthy people don't say such things such as "Trust me, I'm.."; they just do. 
                Only those who are unreliable try to convince you of how integral and trustworthy they are with their words.

                What other behaviors give you a no-go sign immediately? Share with us. We would love to find out. 
            </p>
            <p>
                While there's no one-size-fits-all approach to finding the perfect tenant, these reflections guide us in our journey to keep both our property owners and tenants smiling.

        <div class='article-body'>
            <p>
                In my journey through the real estate landscape, I've had the privilege of collaborating with a diverse array of property owners. 
                Each encounter has offered unique insights into the challenges and opportunities within property management. 
                Today, I want to share some personal advice on optimizing your rental income, drawing from my experiences and the lessons learned along the way. 
                Our discussion revolves around three pivotal questions:
            </p>
            <p>1.       Why does my property deserve a premium rent?</p>
            <p>2.       What factors are diminishing my rental revenue?</p>
            <p style='margin-bottom: 4em;'>3.       Is premium rent the key to maximizing earnings?</p>
            <p><b>1.       Unveiling Premium Rent Potential</b></p>
            <p>
                The quest to justify a premium rent for your property is akin to discovering its unique essence — that special something that convinces prospective tenants they're making the right choice, even at a higher cost. 
                Two words echo in my mind: <b>desirability</b> and <b>scarcity</b>. 
                Your property must not only boast features that tenants crave but also stand out as a rare gem in a sea of options. 
                Here's what I've learned:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Aesthetic EdgeFirst impressions matter profoundly. A property aspiring for premium status must not only promise an upscale living experience but also deliver it visually and functionally. Addressing maintenance issues or aesthetic shortcomings is crucial before setting your sights on a higher rent bracket.</li>
                <li>Timing Is EverythingMy experiences, particularly in the fluctuating Abu Dhabi market, have taught me the critical role of timing. Seasonality can greatly impact rental dynamics, turning what seems like an opportunity for premium rent into a struggle against vacancies. Sometimes, the wiser strategy focuses on swift occupancy rather than holding out for higher rent, especially when vacancies prove more costly in the long run.</li>
                <li>The Early Bird AdvantageTaking possession of a new property from developers as early as possible can set you apart. In the initial scarcity phase, your property can command attention and premium rent before others flood the market. It's a lesson in seizing the moment and distinguishing your offer from the inevitable competition.</li>
                <li>Dynamic Pricing: A Balancing ActUnderstanding the trade-offs tenants are willing to make can guide you in setting a dynamic pricing model. Whether it's flexibility in payment terms or inclusive utilities, each choice comes with its own set of risks and benefits. My mantra here is to always weigh the potential against the pitfalls. </li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>2.       Identifying Revenue Leaks</b></p>
            <p>
                Beyond visible expenses such as service charges and maintenance, vacancy actually represents an even more critical revenue drain for most owners. 
                However, it is often overlooked because it is a silent issue. For every week your property remains empty, you lose nearly 2% of the potential rent, amounting to an 8% loss if the property is vacant for two months. 
                Addressing this effectively has been a cornerstone for our team in quickly maximizing rental income for our clients.
                Additionally, if your property is mortgaged, don't forget to explore cheaper financing options, as this can also lead to significant savings.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p><b>3.       Rethinking Premium Rent</b></p>
            <p>The journey to optimize rental income is nuanced, blending the enhancement of property appeal with strategic market timing and a keen eye on costs. Here are two personal takeaways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Value of ExpertiseAcknowledging the cost of vacancies led me to appreciate the value of professional property management. A competent property manager can be a game-changer, reducing vacancy durations and smoothing out the rental process, thereby safeguarding your income and peace of mind.</li>
                <li>The Strategic UnderpricingSometimes, the counterintuitive strategy of setting the rent slightly below market rate can lead to higher overall earnings, especially when considering the broader context of market dynamics and vacancy losses. It's a delicate balance that requires insight and experience to navigate successfully.</li>
            </ul>

                In sharing these reflections, I hope to offer guidance that resonates with your own property management endeavors. 
                The most common mistakes we see among landlords include being overly picky about the rental offers they receive, being frugal with maintenance bills, and viewing property management or any upgrades to the property as purely an expense. 
                However, they often overlook that the biggest factors draining their finances are incorrect pricing of the property, leaving the property vacant for too long, or being slow to acquire new properties from developers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Don't let your rental income go to waste this way. Follow our advice above, or find a good property manager to assist you.

        <div><i style='color: gray'>March 19, 2024</i></div>
        <div class='article-body'>
            <p>
                Navigating the complexities of the Abu Dhabi rental market has been a profound journey for me, filled with lessons learned and insights gained. Today, I want to share a piece of that journey with you, focusing on a topic that's close to the heart of every landlord: tenant screening. 
                This isn't just about finding a tenant; it's about finding the right tenant who respects and values your property as much as you do.
            </p>
            <p><b>Reevaluating Traditional Screening Methods</b></p>
            <p>
                The traditional tenant screening playbook often see in other markets—requesting employment certificates, bank statements, and reference letters—often don’t work so well in Abu Dhabi. In a market brimming with options, demanding extensive documentation can only push prospective tenants away, ultimately causing our clients to suffer. 
                It's a delicate balance we always have to maintain between due diligence and practicality, and the truth is, those documents don't always reveal the full story.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tenant screening is akin to hiring the right employees for your company. 
                Even if you hire the best candidates on paper or from an interview, in reality, they can still turn out to be full of disappointment.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've come to realize that a tenant's paper profile is not a very good indicator of their real-world behavior. From our company history, all the troublesome tenants, i.e., runaways, defaults on rental payments, property damage during their tenancy, subleases, or just don’t do what they promise, surprisingly come from prestigious positions with professional backgrounds. (But in no way am I saying tenants from prestigious positions are troublesome tenants; in fact, the majority of them are very well-behaved.) 
                This insight has been pivotal in reshaping our approach to tenant screening, moving beyond the conventional metrics to something more intuitive and nuanced.
            </p>
            <p><b>Adapting to the Market's Realities</b></p>
            <p>
                So, how do we adapt? How do we screen tenants in a way that's both effective and mindful of the market's dynamics? 
                Here are a few strategies that have made a difference for us:
            </p>
            <p><b>1.       The Role of Real Estate Agencies</b></p>
            <p>
                Often overlooked by many landlords, choosing the right agencies to work with is a game-changer. Agencies with a solid reputation tend to attract tenants who are reliable and respectful of your property. These agencies have lower churn rates for their agents and are more inclined to step in and assist when you face challenges with your tenants in the future. 
                It's about aligning with partners who understand your values and market expectations.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p><b>2.       Understanding Payment Dynamics</b></p>
            <p>
                The number of payments can be a critical filter. At one point, many landlords and property management companies opened up to 12 payments, but the default rate soared. It’s not only a hassle but a disaster. Opting for fewer payments (we only accept maximum 4 payments) has proven to significantly reduce the risk of rental defaults. It's a strategy that speaks volumes about a tenant's financial stability and commitment. 
                And it's a strategy that you can still play in Abu Dhabi without suffering marketability.

            </p>
            <p><b>3.       Setting a Realistic Security Deposit</b></p>
            <p>
                The security deposit is not just a formality; it's a safeguard. Many landlords believe they can only ask for 5%, which is not true. Imagine the annual rent for your property is only 50k AED, with 5% of the security deposit, that’s only 2,500 AED, which is just about enough to repaint and deep clean. It’s not enough protection for your properties. We suggest keeping at least AED 5,000. 
                A meaningful deposit ensures that tenants have a stake in maintaining the property, bridging the gap between carelessness and responsibility.

            </div>
            <p><b>4.       Beyond the Surface: Looking at Nationality and Culture</b></p>
            <p>
                While it's essential to navigate this aspect sensitively, understanding cultural backgrounds can offer insights into potential tenant behaviors. 
                It's about cultural compatibility and mutual respect, not stereotypes.
            </p>
            <p><b>5.       The Importance of Direct Interactions</b></p>
            <p>
                Finally, the direct interaction with potential tenants can be incredibly telling. It's an opportunity to gauge their expectations, their demeanor, and how they might treat your property. 
                Trust your instincts or your property manager's here—they're often right.
            </p>
            <p><b>Reflecting on Our Approach</b></p>
            <p>
                These strategies are more than just policies; they're a reflection of our commitment to ensuring that both landlords and tenants embark on a rental relationship that's based on mutual respect and understanding. 
                It's about protecting your investment and ensuring that your property remains a place of value and pride.

                Whether you're a seasoned landlord or new to the game, remember that the right approach can turn challenges into opportunities.

        <div class='article-body'>
            <p>
                Recently, a landlord asked me about buying a property in Abu Dhabi. She was curious whether to opt for Airbnb-style leasing or a standard annual lease. Since Abu Dhabi legalized short-term leases, this is a dilemma many landlords face, especially given the premium prices short-term properties can command per day. It's tempting to see this path as a guaranteed way to increase profits. 
                However, like any significant endeavor, a higher return usually involves higher risks. I want to share some considerations to help you make an informed decision.
            </p>
            <p><b>Investing in Your Space</b></p>
            <p>
                First, let's discuss preparing your property. Choosing short-term leasing means your property needs to be visually appealing to attract potential renters. 
                It's not just about adding a comfortable bed and a plush sofa; it's about creating a space that stands out and makes guests fall in love at first sight.
            </p>
            <p>
                Typically, furnishing a one-bedroom (1B) can cost about 15-18k AED with all white goods. 
                But it's not enough to just have the furniture; making everything look good and ensuring your property stands out is crucial.
            </p>
            <p><b>The Nitty-Gritty of Operations</b></p>
            <p>The operational side of running a short-term rental, as opposed to an annual lease, involves higher costs. Here are the fees you need to consider:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Government license fee:</b> About AED 950/year</li>
                <li><b>Property insurance:</b> For a one-bedroom, that's about AED 200-300</li>
                <li><b>Booking platform's fee:</b> Typically 3% for Airbnb</li>
                <li><b>Cleaning and supplies:</b> You need a cleaner to clean, do laundry, and replenish supplies. Coordinating the cleaner's schedule to turn over the property as quickly as possible can be challenging.</li>
                <li><b>Property Manager's fee:</b> High tenant turnover means more work for the property manager. Typically, the PM fee can be 5-7 times more than that of a standard yearly lease. It might be high, but it's worth considering if you need someone to help manage your property.</li>
            </ul>
            <div style='display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center'>
                <img src=${article16BodyImg1} class='article-img' alt='colleagues' loading="lazy"/>

            </div>
            <p><b>Dealing with Vacancies</b></p>
            <p>A significant challenge with short-term leasing is vacancies. Seeing others charge high prices doesn't guarantee instant success.</p>
            <p>Here's a personal story: I once ran a quaint bed and breakfast in London. Over two years, I think I received only one booking from Airbnb. The rest of my guests came from my personal blog.</p>
            <p class='quote'>
                Choosing short-term leasing means your property needs to be visually appealing to attract potential renters. 
                It's not just about adding a comfortable bed and a plush sofa; it's about creating a space that stands out and makes guests fall in love at first sight.
            </p>
            <p>
                This experience taught me the importance of finding ways to attract prospective tenants. Most real estate agencies can't help with sourcing tenants for short-term leases, so it's up to you to find alternative methods to outcompete hotel rooms and other listings. 
                Can you withstand the time it takes to build up reviews on platforms like Airbnb or Booking.com? Do you have other channels for driving bookings?
            </p>
            <p>
                Remember, Abu Dhabi's market experiences specific high and low seasons. During the low season, it can be very quiet. You need to consider these factors as well.
            </p>
            <p><b>Wrapping It Up</b></p>
            <p>
                Both <i><b>short-term leases</b></i> and <i><b>standard one-year leases</b></i> are legitimate options. 
                However, opting for a short-term lease requires more costs, more investment, and a more hands-on approach. 
                I hope this article provides useful information to help you make the right decision for you and your property. 
                So, next time you see those premium prices advertised on booking sites, you won't be easily misled.

                Let's face it, welcoming a new tenant is akin to experiencing a honeymoon period, but the hardest part usually arises when you need to remove a tenant from your property. 
                I think it's definitely one of the top three most stressful moments in the life of a property manager.
            </p>
            <p>
                This situation can truly test a tenant's character (and our patience), especially their willingness to take responsibility for any damages they've caused.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although most tenants are great, friction during move-out is almost inevitable. 
                However, if you follow these steps correctly, the move-out process with your tenant can be much smoother:
            </p>
            <p>
                1.       <b>Start with the Tenancy Contract:</b> Be specific about what you expect from tenants upon move-out. It's standard to ask tenants to restore the property to its original condition, but this often proves too vague. Being specific in the contract helps to manage expectations and responsibilities upon move-out more effectively. 
                For instance, specify whether you expect the tenant to repaint, deep clean, or conduct pest control. You don't need to go overboard, but clarity is key.
            </p>
            <p>
                2.       <b>Insist on a Move-In Inspection Report: </b> It might seem that only tenants need the move-in inspection report, but you'd be surprised how many arguments it can prevent as a landlord. This document is crucial for protecting both parties in the event of a maintenance dispute. Don't overlook the importance of the inspection report. 
                If you can't conduct one yourself, consider hiring a professional (our services include this—contact us for more information). This report is essential for determining responsibilities upon move-out.
            </p>
            <p>
                3.       <b>Clearly Communicate the Move-Out Procedure and Your Expectations: </b> Inform tenants about the move-out process, including any clearances they need to provide, their intended move-out date, your quality expectations for any maintenance work they undertake themselves (especially painting), 
                and when they can expect to receive their security deposit back.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>
                4.       <b>Conduct a Pre-Move-Out Check: </b> If possible, inspect the property before the tenant moves out. Pay special attention to expensive items like carpentry, masonry, furniture, and appliances. 
                If you notice damages that exceed the security deposit, discuss with your tenant how these will be addressed before they leave.

            <p>
                5.       <b>Assist Your Tenant with Getting Permission to Move Out: </b> Some community managements require your No Objection Certificate (NOC) for tenants to move out. 
                Ensure your tenant isn't stranded because they couldn't obtain move-out permission from the community management.
            </p>
            <p>
                6.       <b>Stay in Touch with Tenants After They Move Out: </b> Often, there's work to be done even after a tenant has left your property. 
                Discuss the best way to keep in contact, especially if they plan to leave the country or move to another community. Having a conversation can make concluding the move-out process smoother.
            </p>
            <p>
                7.       <b>Prepare for the Worst-Case Scenario: </b> The biggest challenge you might face is a tenant refusing to move out. 
                Remember, it's better to resolve the situation, even if it means a slight financial loss, than to face the complexities of legal eviction.

            <p>
                These tips can help manage tenant move-outs smoothly. 
                Setting clear expectations from the start, keeping all information handy, informing tenants about the move-out process and what's expected, trying to avoid unexpected expenses that exceed the security deposit, assisting your tenants with their move-out, and staying in touch are all crucial steps.
            </p>
            <p>
                Though these tips may seem like common sense, the quality of execution makes all the difference.

                Since the beginning of this year, we have been contemplating how to strengthen our company's corporate culture. 
                And many that we found valuable to us are actually based from our experiences of being property managers in Abu Dhabi.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here, I am going to share with you the <b>8 lessons</b> that we learned as being property managers in Abu Dhabi. If any resonate with you, let us know!
            </p>
            <p>
                1. <b>Things never go according to plan</b> - We know things usually don't go as planned, but here, they never do. This includes even routine tasks that one day, out of no more, procedures or requirements just change. Planning ahead, allowing plenty of buffers, setting the right expectations early on from all parties, and being almost a control freak to manage every step of the way are crucial for a higher chance of successful delivery.
            </p>
            <p>
                2. <b>Treasure those who can deliver and solve problems</b> - Most people can do their routine work, but immediately feel out of depth when face with unexpected and you find yourself going in circles. However, if you encounter someone who truly understands their role, can solve problems, and deliver results, treasure them; such individuals are rare.
            </p>
            <p>
                3. <b>Don't take no for an answer; there's always a solution</b> - As property managers, we've frequently encountered problems I had no idea how to solve. Many situations are truly bizarre. Yet, to help our clients, we've developed a belief that no matter how challenging a situation, there is always a solution. Being resilient and persistent will lead to a breakthrough.
            </p>
            <p>
                4. <b>See beyond people's emotions</b> - How people handle disagreement and disputes are highly cultural. Being in Abu Dhabi where people are from diverse backgrounds meaning everyone handles it differently, some resolve based on contracts, some shout, some coerce, some insult. Being a property manager has taught me to see beyond what people say but focus on what they truly need and bring them back to paths to problem resolution.
            </p>
            <p>
                5. <b>Words are cheap; only actions matter</b> - In our line of work, we often encounter “sure deals” and “guaranteed promises.” However experiences have taught us that sure thing is never sure when that person actually has a skin in the game. Especially when we handle the situations for our clients' interest, we have to be very careful and make sure we have plan B when those promises fall through.

                Don't take no for an answer; there's always a solution
            </p>
            <p>
                6. <b>Treasure those who call you back</b> - It might seem simple, but many people make empty promises without keeping them. If you come across one who follows through, even with something as simple as returning a call, is rare and should be valued.
            </p>
            <p>
                7. <b>Think outside the box</b> - Problem-solving is a critical skill in Abu Dhabi. Being a property manager here guarantees a never-ending stream of problems and mysteries to solve. You must piece information together and come up with solutions on your own. Patience, resilience, and the ability to think outside the box are essential qualities for a property manager here.

            </div>
            <p>
                8. <b>Be Very Methodical with Documentation</b> - Agents often part ways with a property once a deal is completed, but for property managers like us, our relationship with a property can last for years. If we're not methodical with documentation and don't maintain clear records of all communications with tenants, landlords, or other parties, it will definitely come back to haunt us for something overlooked years ago! And since our skins are not thick enough to turn a blind eyes on our mistakes or ignore inquiries, we have to make sure all documentation and communication are meticulously recorded and organized.

        <div class='article-body'>
            <p>UAE property investment is certainly a hot topic!</p>
            <p>
                Recently, a British friend of mine, nearing retirement, asked me a question about the possibility of investing in UAE properties through crowdsourcing. This question caught me off guard, as I hadn't heard much about crowdsourced investment options in Abu Dhabi, though they're gaining traction in Dubai with companies like Stake and SmartCrowd leading the way.
            </p>
            <p>Prompted by her curiosity, I delved into the subject. Here's what I suggested to her, and if you are also considering to buy properties in the UAE, you need to give it a read.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To know our verdict à point 4</li>
                <li>Pros & Cons with crowdfunding (risks you need to know) à point 3</li>
                <li>How crowdfunding work à point 1& 2</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>1. What is crowdfunding in real estate?</b></p>
            <p>
                Typically, buying a property equates to direct ownership, right? When purchasing with others, you can become joint owners, each listed on the title deed. However, in the UAE, joint ownership is capped at four parties. So, what happens if you wish to share ownership with more than four individuals?
            </p>
            <p>
                The answer lies in establishing a company that owns the property. In this arrangement, investors seeking to own a portion of the property would instead own a corresponding share of the company. For example, if ten individuals aim to invest in a villa, rather than being directly listed on the villa's title deed—a practice not allowed—they can create a company to own the villa. Consequently, they would possess shares in this company. This approach mirrors the operational model of crowdfunding companies. These entities establish a <b>Special Purpose Vehicle</b> (SPV) for each property, thereby making investors the shareholders of the SPV, because compared to the normal type of companies, an SPV is a distinct legal entity designed exclusively for acquiring and financing a specific asset, such as a property in this context. Importantly, the SPV remains unaffected even if the parent companies face bankruptcy. Thus, investors, as shareholders of the SPV, become the official owners of the property.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p><b>2. How does crowdfunding work in the UAE?</b></p>
            <p>Crowdfunding companies manage the SPVs, each owning a property. These companies source attractive investment opportunities, establishing an SPV and registering it with the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) once enough funding is secured. If they fail to attract sufficient investment, the money is returned to investors.</p>

            </p>
            <p><b>3. The pros and cons of crowdfunding investment</b></p>
            <p><b>The Pros:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Low Capital Requirement</b>: The major appeal is that the capital requirement for you to start building up your property investment is as little as only Dh500.</li>
                <li><b>Saves Time</b>: It saves a significant amount of time for investors—they take care of property sourcing, property purchase paperwork, leasing, management headaches, and selling the property.</li>
                <li><b>Risk Diversification</b>: A great way to diversify your risk—property investment is expensive, but with crowdfunding, you can easily diversify your risk into different properties with a small amount of investment.</li>
                <li><b>Potentially High Returns</b>: I use “potential” because it's not clear on the average ROI, but on crowdfunding sites, they usually highlight returns starting from 35% ROI over the entire investment period to as high as 68% or more!</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>The Cons:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Liquidity Issues</b>: SPV is not publicly listed, therefore you can only sell it through the crowdfunding company, which means you have a much smaller pool of investors to sell to, and very little control to crowdfunding companies' mechanism in promoting the sales of your shares.</li>
                <li><b>Legal Protection</b>: Although there's a legal framework protecting the shareholders of an SPV, but given it's a relatively new things in the UAE, it's not entirely clear on how each shareholder can protect his or her rights if the crowdfunding companies go under or shareholders have a dispute with the crowdfunding companies.</li>
                <li><b>Lack of Transparency in Money Management</b>: We saw how crypto tycoon be charged frauds for misleading investors and illegally using investors' monies. Not saying crowdfunding companies will do the same, but there is certainly very little each investor can do to protect their money once it's with crowdfunding companies. </li>
                <li><b>Higher Fees</b>: It's more expensive to purchase properties through crowdfunding companies. Compared to normal sales agents' 2% commission, crowdfunding companies usually charge a 1.5% purchasing fee, an annual administration (management) fee of 0.5%, and an exit fee of typically 2.5%. Some of them also charge for KYC, AML, or capital appreciation fees etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>4. Our Verdict: Overall, is it worth consideration?</b></p>
            <p>Yes, if you can manage your risk carefully and only use an amount that won't cause you too much pain even if you lose it all!</p>
            <p>Crowdfunding poses higher risks in terms of liquidation and legal protection; however, it can be a great tool for diversifying risk by spreading it across your property investment portfolio instead of locking a huge chunk into just one property. It all depends on how you use it.</p>
            <p>Saying that, if you do consider the crowdfunding option, make sure you also research Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs). REITs has been around for longer time, so it offer clearer legal protections. Plus, many REITs are also publicly traded, which makes it much easier to liquidate. Although prices of your share can fluctuate more with market sentiment, but you might appreciate the ease of liquidation and protection more. See which one is your cup of tea.</p>
            <p>Fundamentally, I think crowdfunding is a great way to dip your toes into real estate investment in the UAE, especially in Dubai without costing your bank. However, if I were to do it, or advise anyone to do so, it wouldn't be my major investment source, but rather the icing on the cake. And always, do it with caution and plan for the worst case scenario.</p>

            <p>If buying a property is like finding your Mr. or Ms. Right to marry, then many definitely suffer from the "commitment" issue. For some, the best one is always the next one, and the decision to buy a property is delayed until it's too late to enter the market.</p>
            <p>
                Granted, buying a property involves a large sum of money, and the consequence of making a wrong decision seems huge, especially if this is your first purchase. However, what you don't realize is that the time spent finding the best option may cost you even more, and the best option may never come. What you need instead is not to rely on your gut but a clear strategy that shows you when it's time to make that offer, no matter how scary it seems.
            </p>
            <p>So, what's the strategy? Perhaps the 37% principle is just what you need! Also known as the Optimal Stopping Theory, it aims to show us when the best timing is to take an action which will give us the maximized return in a situation with infinite options. Sounds like finding your best property to buy? 😉</p>
            <p>To break free from your perfectionism and fear, here is how you can use it in your property hunt:</p>
            <p>
                1. Set a timeframe for purchasing a property. You absolutely have to buy one within this timeframe.

                2. Define your criteria for filtering properties, such as location, ROI, or other essential factors. Surely, you don't want to waste your time viewing anything that doesn't meet those requirements, right?

            <p>3. Divide your timeframe into two periods: a viewing period and a selection period. Allocate 37% of the time for viewing and the rest for taking action. During the viewing period, only view properties that meet your criteria but refrain from making any purchases. It's purely property window shopping. But once you are done with the viewing period, you have to take action and snatch the first property you encounter that surpasses all previously viewed options!</p>
            <p>For example, if you aim to purchase a property with a gross ROI above 6% within three months, which is 91 days, then the first 34 days is your viewing period. During this period, you only view properties. Once you complete your 34-day-viewing period, on day 36, if you find a property that surpasses all the previously viewed ones, then that's the one for you to act on! Forget about all the rest you haven't viewed.</p>

            <p>Obviously, the best property might be the next property, but the likelihood of “the best property is the next property” NOT happening is statistically higher. Ultimately, we live in a world with uncertainty and without perfect information. To pursue the slimmer chance of finding the next best property, the only thing you guarantee yourself is wasted time, effort, and opportunity cost. (Plus, you can always introduce more filtering criteria to alleviate some worries).</p>
            <p>So next time, if you suffer from the “commitment issue” again with your property purchase, try adopting the Optimal Stopping Theory. It might be just what you need to push yourself to make the best decision.</p>

            <p>As we witnessed a significant surge in UAE real estate prices in 2022, the UAE has recorded some of the highest increases in housing prices globally, trailing only behind Turkey, according to a Q3 2023 report by the Bank for International Settlements.</p>
            <p>
                Such rapid growth sparks inevitable concerns: Are we approaching a market crash, or is the bubble about to burst? My research aligns with the consensus that while growth may slow, the trend is likely to continue upward. For a detailed analysis, I recommend an insightful summary by SmartCrowd(1), which I will not duplicate here.
            </p>
            <p>However, what I do want to highlight is the stark volatility of the UAE property market. Take a look at the graph below. Its volatility surpasses that of all mature economies. While the US was recovering from the crash in 2008, the UAE had already gone through another round of highs and lows. What took roughly 14 years to recover from in the US, the UAE managed in just 5 years and recovered from the second crash.</p>

                Real estate typically attracts conservative investors looking for long-term holdings. However, those interested in the UAE market should adopt a different approach, treating it more like Bitcoin than a conventional ETF. This market is not for the faint-hearted—it offers substantial returns during peak periods but demands robust portfolio management to mitigate risks and cashflow issue during downturns is the key to successfully investing in UAE's real estate. Certainly there are differences when it comes to investing in Dubai v.s. Abu Dhabi or Ras Al Khaimah, but the markets remain very volatile even comparing to most of the emerging markets.
            </p>
            <p>
                On top of that, to invest in the UAE property markets, investors should keep a vigilant eye on external factors such as oil price fluctuations and 'black swan' events, which can either prompt foreign investors to withdraw their funds or pour heavily into the market. We saw this in the 2008 crash and the recent rise in property prices driven by Russian investors. These factors, largely outside the UAE government's control, play a crucial role in the real estate price dynamics.

            <p>I know most of us think of a Golden Visa as merely a nice-to-have item, but it might very well become a necessity that everyone should seriously consider. Why? The answer is simple—risk management.</p>
            <p>You might ask, 'What risk are you talking about? I see no risk around me; what should I be managing?' If this is your thought, then think again.</p>
            <p>In 2021, Chinese President Xi Jinping predicted that the trend of the world is 'chaos.' This message was reiterated to Russian President Vladimir Putin on March 22, 2023, when President Xi stated, 'Right now, we're seeing a change we haven't seen in 100 years, and we are driving this change together.' This statement came a year and a month after Russia invaded Ukraine.</p>
            <p>With the wars that have broken out between Israel and Palestine, Israel and Iran, and the intensified tensions over the Taiwan Strait and between North and South Korea, I believe we have sufficient evidence to validate President Xi's prediction.</p>
            <p>Prominent figures like Bridgewater's Ray Dalio have also discussed the likely fall of the US empire in the foreseeable future, which will inevitably lead to more conflicts and chaos.</p>
            <p>So, with so much turmoil ahead of us, what are you doing now to protect yourself and your family in the future? What measures are you taking to protect your wealth and assets? Diversification and having a place where you and your family can quickly and safely relocate is no longer a luxury, but a real necessity. This applies not just to Taiwanese folks like me but to everyone.</p>

                One useful strategy is to obtain a second passport from a safe country, providing a place of residence in times of turmoil. However, obtaining a second passport is not always possible, as many countries do not allow their citizens to hold dual nationality, and the process can be lengthy, costly, and challenging.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's why, in my opinion, the UAE's Golden Visa is such a good alternative option to consider. Granted, it's not citizenship, but it functions similarly, allowing you to have a visa for 10 years, which is easily renewable. You can also sponsor your family with it. The fact that it is not citizenship actually works in favor of many where dual nationalities are not allowed. Plus, it's quick and easy to obtain. Providing that you meet the criteria, you can get your Golden Visa in as little as two weeks to a month.

            <p>Additionally, with benefits like no income tax, a stable currency, rich natural resources, good infrastructure, a favorable lifestyle for expats, and the safety of the entire country (Abu Dhabi is the safest city in the world), the UAE is really an ideal place for many to consider. Even if you are in the process of obtaining your second passport, it's still a viable option in the interim.</p>
            <p>
                I believe that as more people realize the risks of putting all their eggs in one basket (one country), the UAE will become more appealing, attracting more investment to drive asset prices. Although whether the asset prices will continue to rise also depends on the quantity of supply, the UAE is inevitably at the right place and the right time for investors to consider. And if you are really risk-averse and concerned about the sharp rises and declines in UAE housing prices, you also have the option of maintaining a 2-million-dirham fixed deposit with banks to earn some interest.

            <p>If there's a will, there's a way.</p>
            <p>
                However, the point of this article is not to discuss how to obtain the Golden Visa, but rather to highlight a more serious and still overlooked topic of why it's something that needs to be taken seriously. If you understand where the world is heading, the UAE's Golden Visa might just be what you need to protect yourself and your family as we navigate a world of growing risk and uncertainty.

        <div><i style='color: gray'>May 20, 2024</i></div>
        <div class='article-body'>
            <p>Over the weekend, a friend of mine—a fellow mom—asked me an interesting question. She wants to invest in UAE property with a budget of 1 million dirhams and hopes to use this investment to obtain the Golden Visa.</p>
            <p>I bet many of you have had similar thoughts. You want the Golden Visa, but the 2 million AED requirement seems daunting. Plus, there's the worry that property prices in the UAE might keep rising before you can save up the 2 million AED needed to invest.</p>
            <p>So, can you make the most of the 1 million AED you have now to work towards your Golden Visa goal? Absolutely. Here are four ways to get started: (If you have other ideas, I'd love to hear them too!)</p>
            <p>1. <b>Start with the Investor Visa</b> - While the Golden Visa often steals the spotlight as a fantastic 10-year residency option, don't overlook the Investor Visa. With a real estate investment of just 750k AED, you can get a 2-year visa.</p>
            <p>2. <b>Buy Smaller Properties</b> - One great aspect of the Golden Visa scheme is that you can combine properties to meet the 2 million AED threshold, as long as the properties are within the same emirate. You can start with a 1-bedroom property for 800k AED this year (and get your investor visa). Next year, you could buy another 1-bedroom for 700k AED, and in the third year, a studio for 500k AED. This way, you're gradually building up your property investment portfolio and working towards that 10-year Golden Visa.</p>
            <p>3. <b>Invest in Off-Plan Projects and Pay in Installments</b> - If you're working with limited finances, off-plan projects are a fantastic option. The initial down payment is lower, and you can pay off the investment in installments. As long as the total amount you pay towards your off-plan property reaches 2 million AED or more, you can apply for your Golden Visa. Just be sure to carefully evaluate any off-plan projects and choose reputable developers.</p>
            <p>4. <b>Mortgage</b> - This can be a bit more challenging if you're not already a UAE resident, but it's doable. We've had clients who successfully navigated this path. With 1 million AED, you could purchase a property worth 2 million AED by taking out a 50% mortgage. Although you can't immediately apply for your Golden Visa—since the amount paid by you less the mortgage should be 2 million AED or more—you can lock in the current property price, secure the property you love without worrying about future price increases, and potentially start earning from the rent. Once you pay off your mortgage and meet the 2 million AED investment requirement, you can apply for your Golden Visa.</p>

            </div>
            <p>
                Lastly, I want to emphasize that this post focuses on those wanting to get the Golden Visa through real estate investment. 
                However, this isn't the only way to obtain the Golden Visa. The UAE government has opened up several categories that support Golden Visa applications. 
                You can check them out here <a href='https://tinyurl.com/visa-categories-uae'>https://tinyurl.com/visa-categories-uae</a>. 
                There are also many other visa categories to consider if you're simply looking for residency (check out here <a href='https://tinyurl.com/residence-visas'>https://tinyurl.com/residence-visas</a>).</p>
            <p>That said, real estate investment or a fixed deposit investment of 2 million AED is still likely the most straightforward and popular route. If you want to learn more about the Golden Visa, real estate, or property management, feel free to reach out!</p>

            <p>I believe that during any economic cycle, there will always be talk of an impending crash or burst of a bubble. Therefore, it's not news when someone makes such a prediction, and we probably shouldn't pay too much attention to it. However, when not just one or two, but several prominent figures are talking about an upcoming drastic change, we should certainly give it some thought.</p>
            <p>Our current economy seems to be heading towards a potential catastrophe. Among investors, whether in real estate, stocks, Bitcoin, or commodities, many are cheering for a bullish 2024. However, more and more prominent investors worldwide warn us that a “<b>drastic change</b>” is about to come.</p>
            <p>Ray Dalio, Founder of Bridgewater® Associates, says we are on the brink of a period of “great disorder”. Howard Marks, Co-chairman of Oaktree Capital Management, says we are going to see the third “sea change” coming soon. Robert Kiyosaki, author of the best-selling financial education book <i>Rich Dad Poor Dad</i>, says a big storm is brewing in the world economy.</p>
            <p>Although no one can predict exactly when this drastic change will occur, it is the trend we are heading towards.</p>
            <p>With the shift in global political dynamics and advancements in technology, the ramifications of this change are less predictable. So “be prepared” is probably the best advice to keep in mind when making our investment decisions. Above all, “diversification” will be the best strategy to navigate through a period of uncertainty.</p>

            </p>
            <p>In this article, I am going to summarize the investment advice from Ray Dalio, Howard Marks, and Robert Kiyosaki.</p>
            <p><b>Howard Marks</b></p>
            <p>Howard Marks emphasizes a cautious approach to investment, given the current economic uncertainties. He advocates for:</p>
            <p>1. Credit Market Investments: Marks recommends a significant allocation to high-quality credit instruments, which offer attractive returns in a higher interest rate environment. He believes that credit markets provide better risk management and yield opportunities compared to equities in the current cycle.</p>
            <p>2. Cautious Equity Investments: Marks suggests focusing on high-quality companies and maintaining a balanced equity allocation to navigate market volatility.</p>
            <p>3. Role of Cash: Marks values holding cash for its optionality, allowing investors to capitalize on market downturns and opportunities.</p>
            <p>4. Bitcoin and Precious Metals: Marks doesn't believe there is much intrinsic value in these assets. Their worth is determined by what others are willing to pay, but they can still be included in small portions in a portfolio.</p>
            <p>So if we make a hypothetical guess on Marks' ideal portfolio, probably it will be something like this.</p>
            <p>- Credit Market Investments: 50-60%</p>
            <p>- Equities (High-Quality Companies): 20-30%</p>
            <p>- Real Estate: 10-20%</p>
            <p>- Speculative Assets (Precious Metals, Bitcoin): Minimal allocation, if any</p>
            <p><b>Ray Dalio</b></p>
            <p>Ray Dalio's investment philosophy centers around diversification and balancing risk. His famous All Weather Portfolio includes:</p>
            <p>1. A mix of 30% stocks, 40% long-term treasury bonds, 15% intermediate-term treasury bonds, 7.5% gold, and 7.5% commodities. This diversified approach helps manage risks across different economic conditions.</p>
            <p>2. On cash: Unlike Marks' opinion on cash, Dalio is generally wary of holding too much cash due to inflation risks and prefers assets that provide real returns, such as commodities and real estate.</p>
            <p><b>Robert Kiyosaki</b></p>
            <p>Robert Kiyosaki's investment strategy focuses on tangible assets. From his own portfolio, he advocates holding:</p>
            <p>1. Gold, Silver, and Bitcoin: 75% of the portfolio. This allocation includes physical gold and silver, as well as Bitcoin. Kiyosaki emphasizes these assets due to their intrinsic value and their ability to serve as a hedge against inflation and economic instability.</p>
            <p>2. Real Estate and Oil Stocks: 25% of the portfolio. This portion of the portfolio should be invested in real estate and oil stocks. Real estate provides income and potential for appreciation, while oil stocks are considered valuable due to the critical role of oil in the economy and its relatively stable value.</p>
            <p>3. Avoiding Cash: Kiyosaki is critical of holding cash, considering it a depreciating asset in an inflationary environment.</p>

            <p><b>The Role of Real Estate Investment</b></p>
            <p>From the above summaries of the three prominent financial figures' investment strategies, we can see their opinions generally differ on precious metals, Bitcoin, and cash. However, there are two things that they all agree on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Diversification strategy becomes increasingly crucial in an uncertain world.</b></li>
                <li><b>Real Estate remains a vital component of a diversified portfolio, especially in the current economic context.</b></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Here's why:</p>
            <p>1.       Tangible Asset with Intrinsic Value: Real estate is one of the few physical assets that actually has a generally recognized intrinsic value. Unlike precious metals or Bitcoin, whose claims of intrinsic value are often debated.</p>
            <p>2.       Income Generation: Properties can offer consistent cash flow through rental income, which is crucial during periods of economic uncertainty and market volatility.</p>
            <p>3.       Inflation Hedge: Real estate values and rental incomes typically rise with inflation, preserving the purchasing power of investments.</p>
            <p>4.       Diversification: Including real estate in a portfolio helps diversify investment risks, balancing the volatility of stocks and the fixed income from bonds.</p>
            <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
            <p>I feel we are walking in some kind of darkness right now. We know the direction we are heading, but we can't see clearly when it's going to happen and how it's going to happen. All we know is that many things that were once stable or taken for granted have now been shaken.</p>
            <p class='quote'>One thing is certain: we are in an era of uncertainty.</p>
            <p>However, even though we don't know the exact details, by incorporating insights from Howard Marks, Ray Dalio, and Robert Kiyosaki, investors can better prepare for economic uncertainties.</p>
            <p>Lastly, it's worth mentioning that although real estate is generally considered a conservative investment, whether property prices go up or down in the short term largely depends on supply and demand, the level of leverage in a given economy (interest rates), and the financial vehicles used (like REITs, land, leased properties, etc.). Nothing is certain in our uncertain world, but choosing the right property to invest in will certainly strengthen the robustness of your investment portfolio.</p>
            <p>By understanding and giving deeper thought into how we structure our own portfolios, we will be in better shape when something drastic happens.</p>

        <h1 class='article-title'>A Peek into How 320 Rich Families Actually Allocate Their Assets</h1>
        <div><i style='color: gray'>June 4, 2024</i></div>
        <div class='article-body'>
            <p>Last week, I shared insights from financial legends. This week, we are going to take a look into how rich people actually do their portfolio management. UBS just released its annual Global Family Office Report on 22 May 2024. This report surveyed 320 rich family offices and offers a glimpse into how these wealthiest, with an average net worth of USD 2.6 billion, actually put their money into.</p>
            <p><b>Portfolio Diversification:</b></p>
            <p>Diversification is certainly a major theme here. The report shows that more family offices are focusing on diversification and prefer more active management of their portfolios. Fixed income in developed markets has been gaining favor, marking the biggest shift in five years.</p>
            <p>In terms of real estate investment, although it saw the biggest dip in 2023, dropping from 13% in 2022 to 10% due to concerns over commercial properties, it is expected to rebound to 12% in 2024. This indicates a cautious yet optimistic approach towards this asset class.</p>
            <p><b>Regional Concerns and Greatest Perceived Risks in the Future:</b></p>
            <p>Across all family offices, the top concern in the next 12 months is geopolitical conflict (58%), followed by worries about higher inflation (39%) and higher interest rates (37%).</p>
            <p>For the long-term outlook over the next five years, geopolitical conflict once again tops the list with 62% concerned, followed by climate change (49%) and a debt crisis (48%).</p>
            <div style='display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center'>
                <img src=${article25BodyImg1} class='article-img' alt='asset allocation' loading="lazy"/>

            </div>
            <p><b>Two</b>particularly interesting points to highlight are:</p>
            <p>1. Middle Eastern family offices are unique in that their top concern over the next five years is a major financial market crisis (57%), and they also seem to be the most in favor of real estate investment compared to their global peers.</p>
            <p>2. Despite the high concern about geopolitical conflict, the Asia-Pacific region (excluding Greater China) is ranked second only to North America as the region where 35% of family offices are looking to increase allocations to capture growth.</p>
            <p class='quote'>
                In terms of real estate investment, although it saw the biggest dip in 2023, dropping from 13% in 2022 to 10% due to concerns over commercial properties, it is expected to rebound to 12% in 2024. This indicates a cautious yet optimistic approach towards this asset class.
            </p>
            <p>This report not only reveals how rich families are actually allocating their assets but also provides regional perspectives on how they view the world, the opportunities, and the risks. Interestingly, although the Asia-Pacific region is generally considered a hotspot for geopolitical tension, it remains a favored destination for increasing portfolio allocations. It seems that the best returns are happening in some of the most challenging areas now.</p>

        <h1 class='article-title'>Understanding the Value of Real Estate Brokers in Abu Dhabi</h1>
        <div><i style='color: gray'>June 5, 2024</i></div>
        <div class='article-body'>
            <p>Navigating the intricate and dynamic real estate market of Abu Dhabi can be as daunting as finding a needle in a haystack, or worse, finding a parking spot in downtown during rush hour. As potential buyers, you're often faced with a critical choice: should you buy directly from a developer, dazzled by promises of sky-high returns, or should you enlist the expertise of a seasoned real estate broker? While buying from a developer might seem straightforward and tempting, the advantages of working with a knowledgeable broker are numerous and impactful. This article will explore why engaging a broker is the smartest move for anyone looking to invest in Abu Dhabi's vibrant real estate market.</p>
            <p><b><i>So, why choose a Real Estate Broker over a Developer?</i></b></p>
            <p><b>1. Accountability and Experience</b></p>
            <p>Think of developers as enthusiastic cheerleaders, always ready to highlight the most optimistic scenarios, often involving astronomical returns on investment. However, what they frequently overlook is the <b>realistic and comprehensive picture of the market</b>. This is where a real estate broker steps in like a seasoned coach. With a deep understanding of the market, including current trends, future projections, and the quirks of different neighborhoods, brokers offer practical and tailored advice. They are accountable to their clients and aim to build long-term relationships, ensuring your best interests are always at the forefront.</p>
            <p><b>2. Comprehensive Market Insight</b></p>
            <p>A broker has their finger on the pulse of the market in a way that developers simply cannot match. Continuously updated with the latest data and trends, brokers provide accurate and timely advice. Whether it's potential for capital growth, rental yields, or the optimal time to buy or sell, brokers offer insights that can significantly impact the success of your investment. In other words, they are your personal GPS in the vast expanse of the real estate buying landscape.</p>
            <p><b>3. Rental and Handover Services</b></p>
            <p>Developers often excel at selling properties but fall short when it comes to rental and property management services. After the sale, they tend to disappear like a mirage in the desert. In contrast, a good broker offers end-to-end services, including finding tenants, managing properties, and handling all aspects of the handover process. This comprehensive service ensures your investment is well-maintained and continuously generating income, sparing you the hassle of management.</p>
            <p><b>4. Strategic Investment Planning</b></p>
            <p>A broker's role goes beyond facilitating a single transaction. Think of them as your financial architect, helping you develop long-term investment strategies tailored to your financial goals and timelines. For instance, a broker might advise you to purchase a property, hold it for a few years to allow for capital appreciation, and then sell it to reinvest in higher-yield properties. This approach can compound your returns and build a robust property portfolio over time.</p>
            <p><i>The Importance of Personalized Service</i></p>
            <p>In real estate, one size does not fit all. Every investor's situation is unique, and a cookie-cutter approach rarely works. A reputable broker takes the time to understand your specific needs, financial situation, and long-term goals. By doing so, they can recommend properties and investment strategies that are genuinely in your best interest. This personalized service is crucial in making informed decisions that align with your overall financial plan.</p>
            <p><i>The Power of Delayed Gratification</i></p>
            <p>Real estate investment is often a long-term game, much like planting a tree and waiting for it to bear fruit. The concept of delayed gratification—reinvesting profits for future gains rather than seeking immediate income—can significantly enhance your wealth over time. A good broker will emphasize the importance of this strategy, helping you build a portfolio that maximizes capital growth and future rental income. By continuously reinvesting and strategically growing your investment pool, you can achieve substantial financial stability and growth.</p>

            </div>
            <p><i>Trust and Transparency</i></p>
            <p>Transparency is the bedrock of a successful client-broker relationship. A trustworthy broker will be candid about potential risks and realistic about expected returns. They provide a balanced view of the market, helping you avoid common pitfalls and make well-informed decisions. This level of transparency builds trust and ensures that you feel confident and secure in your investment choices.</p>

            <p>The real estate market in Abu Dhabi offers exciting opportunities, but navigating it successfully requires more than just optimism and basic market knowledge. Engaging a professional, experienced real estate broker can provide the expertise, accountability, and comprehensive services that are crucial for making the best investment decisions.

            <p>In a constantly changing market of real estate investments, the value of a skilled broker cannot be overstated. They are not just intermediaries; they are strategic partners dedicated to helping you achieve long-term financial success. Trusting in their expertise and allowing them to guide your investment strategy is a decision that can significantly enhance your returns and ensure your peace of mind. So, the next time you think about diving into the Abu Dhabi real estate market, remember: having a broker by your side is like having a seasoned pilot guiding you through turbulent skies—essential for a smooth and successful journey.</p>

        <h1 class='article-title'>My Shocking and Painful Experiences of Buying a Property in the UK</h1>
        <div><i style='color: gray'>June 11, 2024</i></div>
        <div class='article-body'>
            <p>Being a property manager and owning a property in Abu Dhabi for over 7 years made me think I knew everything about purchasing and managing properties…until I bought one myself in Manchester, UK.</p>
            <p>Right from the start, I knew the process would be different. But I didn't expect them to be so different and, frankly…painful.</p>
            <p>Being a property manager in Abu Dhabi, can sometimes feel like a small-town girl, wondering how the international standard of real estate transaction and property management service must be like. I was ready to soak in all the lessons learning from the best before I started my purchasing journey. But it turned out, the only brilliant part was the real estate agency in Abu Dhabi that sold me the property, the rest of the service providers in the UK dropped the ball everywhere, leaving me, an international buyer, confused and suffering.</p>
            <p><b>Why am I even paying for my solicitor who can't be bothered to do their findings?</b></p>
            <p>Mine really wasn't a complicated case. I bought it straight from the developer without any mortgage. The solicitor I hired was recommended by the developer and my agent since they are very experienced with this project.</p>
            <p>It turned out, their findings were frankly laughable and appalling. They claimed the building was still under construction when residents had already moved in, and my agent did a better job at obtaining the correct service charge amount than those “professional solicitors”.</p>
            <p>I had to proofread, supposedly, legal report 3 times and each time with corrections. It's obvious that they simply copied and pasted what they previously did for other clients without verifying the information before sending it to me. However, despite their lack of professionalism, not a single one of them apologized for their mistakes or the inconvenience they caused to their clients. How nice.</p>
            <p><b>Duly signed SPA is not a common sense.</b></p>
            <p>When my solicitor informed me that the sales transfer was done, I expected to see a duly signed sales and purchase agreement (SPA) from both the seller and the buyer, like how it is done in Abu Dhabi, and most of the world, I'd assume.</p>
            <p><b>Wrong. Not in England.</b></p>
            <p>Instead of a duly signed SPA, I got one signed copy by the seller, and one copy signed by the buyer (by my solicitor).</p>
            <p>Very confused, I asked can I have a duly signed copy where both the buyer and the seller's signatures are in one copy. (Considering how many mistakes they made, I couldn't trust them even if they attested the copies are the same).</p>
            <p>My solicitor simply responded, this is the standard procedure in England, and they cannot assist me further to obtain the duly signed version.</p>
            <p>Very polite.</p>

            </div>
            <p><b>Delays in Registration</b></p>
            <p>In Abu Dhabi, upon the completion of the sales transfer, the buyer receives a shiny title deed under their name. But once again, I failed to recognize that the UK and Abu Dhabi are very different. Something that takes Abu Dhabi Municipality 10 minutes to do takes the UK's local authority, according to my solicitor, 6 months to a year (or even longer) to register the title under my name. After informing me to be patient indefinitely, my solicitor disappeared, leaving me clueless about the status of my title registration. Eventually, seven months later, I confirmed the property title was registered under my name because I received an official letter from a debt collection agency about my outstanding ground rent, “thoughtfully” including a copy of my register of title!</p>
            <p><b>Questioning the Role of My Property Manager</b></p>
            <p>Owning a property management business in Abu Dhabi, I was shocked by the scope of work in the UK. Back to the overdue ground rent from the debt collector, I asked my property manager why they didn't pay the ground rent on my behalf since they received all the rental from my tenant before wiring me the balance. They said it wasn't their scope of work. Apparently, it also wasn't their scope of work to send me any posts delivered to my address in the UK on time, which is how the ground rent invoice became overdue.</p>
            <p>Not long after settling my ground rent overdue, I received another notice of my service charge overdue, with fines imposed. Outraged, I asked my property manager why this was also overdue. The answer was the same: it wasn't her scope of work to pay the overdue service charge. She advised me to register my property directly with the service charge billing company's portal so I could receive communication via email.</p>
            <p>Fine. I immediately registered my property with the service charge billing company's portal to avoid missing any invoices. Wrong. Another month later, I received another overdue notice with fines, this time for my parking slot. Puzzled, I wondered why I had any outstanding bills without any email communication. But this time, I didn't bother asking my property manager. I contacted the customer service of the service charge billing portal and found out I needed to register my parking as a separate “property” on their portal and pay a separate service charge for it.</p>
            <p>This is beyond confusing for an international investor, as in Abu Dhabi, the service charge includes your parking space, so you only pay once and don't have to register separately. At least for my company, we always try to help settle any outstanding bills for our clients before wiring them the rent, leaving them worry-free about the nitty-gritty of property upkeep. But perhaps this “standard” service is not so standard.</p>
            <div style='display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center'>
                <img src=${article27BodyImg2} class='article-img' alt='financial reminder' loading="lazy"/>
                <div class='img-caption' style='margin-top: 0.5em'><a style='text-decoration: none; color: gray' href='https://www.transparentpm.ae/'>www.transparentpm.ae</a></div>
            </div>
            <p>Don't get me wrong, I still see the value of having a property manager in the UK, but sometimes, I wonder what justifies their rates, which are double what my company charges in Abu Dhabi, for doing less.</p>
            <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
            <p>This is my true story, just the tip of the iceberg of all the confusion and struggles I went through to purchase and keep this property in the UK. I still believe my investment decision is correct, but too many service providers and no one feeling ultimately responsible to their clients means the ball got dropped everywhere. Every time I picked it up, there was a financial consequence. I just wish someone could have held my hand better from the beginning to the end, explaining even the nitty-gritty details like registering both the parking and property on the service provider's portal.</p>
            <p>As a lesson learned from my painful experiences, we are not going to do that to our clients. We hold each client's hand throughout the entire sales process and even after the sale is done. We only let them go once we know the seller's name is removed from all the billing companies' communication, and the buyer is registered with them.</p>
            <p>If you are an international buyer or seller and don't want to go through this horror of being charged for not knowing what's going on, let us know. In addition to your sales agents, we can assist with all the documentation, inform you about the sales process, and take care of the post-sales stuff for you.</p>
            <p>I wish your transaction much smoother than mine.</p>
